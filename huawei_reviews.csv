I had android years ago, so I thought I would just go back to it, plus apple doesn't make products in this price range really.  My biggest fear was trying to transfer data, and it did prove to be trying and not completely successful.  Got photos, music (had to buy a converter from wma to aac format) and my ringtone ok.  Only got sms texts transferred using an app, but lost my mms and contacts.  Oh well, I just made do.  I am a very light smart phone user so..... not a big deal.

This phone itself, I really like.  Ultimately popped in the sim card from windows phone and this one took off.  Screen is great for me, I got my apps loaded and I am very satisfied with this phone.  Photos are certainly good enough.  I cannot seem to figure out how to get a shadow screen to open up when I take it out of my pocket, I always have to push the button.  Probably a security thing.  I don't use the fingerprint scanner, opted out of that so I cannot comment on it.  Like that it has a headphone jack, and I added a 128 sd card.

I am a light user of this phone.  I am not on it constantly.  Probably twenty texts a day, the occasional phone call, some news reading, etc.  So far the battery has lasted days for me.  At least 3, and I was still at 40%.  I turn off location, bluetooth and notifications since I don't use them daily and I am sure that helps with the battery.

This phone is faster than my nokia windows phone (950) which was one of their better phones at the time.  For under $300 I think this is a fantastic phone.  My understanding is that this phone will be supported into the future, even if Huawei is banned from Google support, as a kind of grandfathering for products already in consumer hands.  It is a pretty phone (peacock blue) and feels solid to me.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy another.
UPDATE 8/27/2019  As this is an international version, the android stuff is not as up to snuff as getting a US Version phone from ATT.  One thing that I noticed after some use which bugged me, is that the resolution of the attached photos I would send in the messaging app was very poor.  Blurry and no detail, it really toned down the resolution.  The answer was to change messaging apps from the stock android to something else.  I tried TEXTRA, and voila, the photo resolution improved immensely.  Problem solved.",4,,

The features on this phone are pretty cool. I love the phone clone app that allowed me to download my call logs and text messages from my old phone. Also I have AT&T service and I did not need to call AT&T to activate my phone I just put in the SIM card and the phone worked. I like the features of the scrolling screenshot and the time limit that you can set on screen time. the camera on this phone is much better then the camera on my LG Stylo 4 I had previously. However the camera is not as good as my husband's LG G5. Setting up the fingerprint scanner was easy and fast and I like that it allows me fast access to the phone. Overall I am giving this phone 5 stars. also as a side note the case and screen protector that is included with the phone and the headphones are not the greatest quality but they are good enough to get you started and hold you over until your case arrives. I ordered a love mei case to go with this phone and it is an excellent fit.,5,,

Pixel cost around 400$ and p30 lite 260-290$. In my opinion pixel won( camera resolution, screen, google storage, google services).

FYI
Network test T-mobile.
The biggest disappointment was that p30 lite 4G LTE test was 2-3x less that pixel 3 xl. p30 lite-on the T-mobile network gets 4-8mbps and pixel 3xl around 20-25mbps.

P30 lite not bad phone if you compare phones under 300$.",3,,

I relalized that their products dont have the ability to connect to 5ghz wifi networks. They only connect to 2.4ghz wifi networks. So if u only have 5ghz networks then this might not be that good of a phone. The fingerprint reader is indeed pretty quick but the battery life is lacking. I had their mate 10 and the battery last way longer than this product. I thought it would be better and last longer but i was wrong. Overall this is a 6.5/10 phone for its price.

The price is right for this 128 gb phone.  I had it for one day now.  Overall, I am quite happy with it.  The lag time doing in negotiation is quite negligible to me and flow is quite smooth.  I do not know how good the camera is, although the few pictures and videos I took were quite acceptable.  I generally used a Canon SLR camera for photos, and this is just to be used for quickie and convenient use only.  It did not detect my 5g or AC wifi, but somebody in the review has always pointed out, so it is within my expectation.  Using speedtest with 2.4ghz wifi, I got 74.7 mbps download speed.  I am not sure if it is just my cloud content or it is Google problem, but I like to warn that if you Google backup to install all the apps previously installed in the other phone, it created a display sleep problem.  The phone would go to sleep every eight seconds if there was no activity, no matter what battery performance or sleep timeout setting I changed to.  I had to solve the problem by resetting the phone to the original factory setting and reinstalling each application manually one by one through the play store.  I got the solution from other users in the internet having the similar problem with Huawei phone and other brands phones so this maybe a common problem with the Google backup.  Likely, it could be the content stored in this backup, but I do not care to find out as I do not have the problem any more.  It also seems that I have an easier time to synchronize the windows 10 contact and calendar apps through the outlook.com with the phone built-in contact and calendar apps, than my old phone.  It took me about three hours to re-install all the apps, about 40 of them and to complete the email, contact and calendar setups.",5,,

It is a backup for my S7 Edge, which is having battery problems.
The Huawei Y7 2019 is actually slightly taller and wider than the Gallaxy S7 Edge.
I am loading it with my apps and contacts now.
Seems a pretty good smartphone, just have to learn it's unique features and differences.
I needed a less expensive phone than the Samsung Galaxy series.  Huawei seems to fill the bill well.
Edit to add:
After a few months use, I am impressed with this cellphone.  The bigger size is great for typing - less chance of fatfingering keys.  Also excellent for watching YouTube videos.
Battery life is very good.  With full charge I can surf my forums, check e-mail and Amazon orders, and watch a 15 minute video, and it still shows 100%.  By comparison the Galaxy S7 is down to 96%.
The learning curve for the Huawei is short.

It even has 64GB in internal storage who can beat that, and it's Dual Sim Card along with ability to take moving pictures. An option not available on the Huawei Y7 2019. I absolutely prefer the Huawei Y9 2019 over the Huawei Y7 2019.

Your videos show clear as daylight, I'm able to stream videos at 1020p now! I wasn't able to on the Huawei Y7 2019, now I can ??. I'm definitely glad I made the switch.

I totally give this phone a rating of 5 stars. The processor and overall performance of this phone up there with phones that range between $500-$800. Definitely recommended individuals to purchase this beautiful device.

Super customizable. Has Huawei and Google store. Comes with a case and headphones! Color is super cute. And the battery last all day with heavy use. The camera is not the worst but wish it was better in low light. Of course it's a budget phone but well worth money paid. Face ID sensor works great.

The phone is completely worth it the only thing I'm not completely in love with is the camera, is not bad it takes pretty good pictures but previously owned a zte axon 7 and the quality is lower on the Huawei Y9 which we don't mind honestly since this Huawei is not as expensive as the axon it is expected. But for the price is definitely a must buy we were weary of buying it because we saw a couple reviews and answers saying it might only take 2g or 3g but it received a 4g signal and everything works smoothly, we are currently using Cricket Wireless as our service provider. We had only purchased one phone to check if we like it and if it worked with Cricket and now we're ready to make another purchase because we loved it.",4,,

I did a lot of research into which one I should buy and a settled on the p20 lite. Ever since I bought it it has been an absolute pleasure to use. The android skin is one of the best I've used so far, the cameras are amazing, and the speed in most applications is great too. One thing that does happen, however is the phone will freeze. It only happens like once every 2 or 3 months, but still an issue. Also snapchat is terrible on it, but that is no fault of Huawei, it seems to be an optimization issue that only snapchat itself can fix.

Build Quality is second to none, camera is insane! It takes incredible photos in any lighting.
It is fast and has a battery that lasts all day with fairly heavy use. The facial recognition is faster than the iPhone x and accurate. The fingerprint sensor is located on the upper rear of the phone on the P20 light as opposed to the front on the P20 Pro. After having phones with sensors in both places, I prefer the rear as your finger just naturally falls into the spot naturally.
The facial recognition is so fast though it actually unlocks sometimes before you can use your fingerprint!
Another feature this phone has that most other high-end phones such as the iPhone and Samsung don't have is an SD card slot. Being able to upgrade your memory is priceless. The cost of SD cards is so low anymore you can take a few with you on vacation and not worry about running out of space for all your HD videos and photos.
Software and firmware updates are rolled out frequently and Huawei support is always great which is amazing since they aren't sold in the USA. You are currently forced to purchase an unlocked international version. If they were available for sale locally in the United States, there is no doubt that they would be the best selling phones.
One last thing, when you purchase these, you don't end up with tons of bloat ware from AT&T or Tmobile etc. You get a nicely skinned clean version of Android that gets upgraded often. You don't need to worry about your carrier rolling out updates. AT&T deliberately holds back updates in order to slow down your phone and make you want to upgrade to the latest and greatest version of Android or whatever OS you have. Display is great with vivid colors and crystal clear even in bright sunlight.
I can go on and on about how great this company is and how great their products are but you really need to give them a try. I truly believe you will not be disappointed. You will be recommending them to everyone you meet though and you will become a fan boy or fangirl!",5,,

One of the best for the money,"Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2018","I'll have a full review with photos incoming, but here are the basic pros and cons:

Pros: Beautiful design that stands out. Notch display design allows for a high screen to body ratio and more usable screen area on a compact body. Feels sturdy in the hand. Good tactile feel of buttons. Quick and accurate fingerprint scanner. Display is vivid without looking oversaturated and bright enough to use in all but direct sunlight. Notch never intrudes on content. Good cameras. Very strong CPU performance. Good battery life.

Cons: Glass back is more prone to damage, necessitates extra careful handling or use of protective cases. No water resistance. Single band WiFi. Weak GPU performance.

Of course as many apple freaks know everytime there is an update the phone seems to slow. I was so sick and tired of my iPhone 6plus. The battery wouldn't even last me a half a day even with power saver mode on. Everything was lagging, but I wasn't willing to invest hundreds of dollars for another iphone. I did alot of research on Huawei and all the youtube reviews and tech websites seemed to agree. My husband has the Samsung 9 and this phone holds up just as good compared to this. The pictures are by far better, sharper, and vibrant then my iPhone ever was. I have a Google hub and because this is Android everything is so much easier and synched. Google is kicking ass hands down and being able to access my goodle home and assistant makes my life a breeze. I was concerned switching from the iPhone ios to Android but it was so simple with the app provided in the setup. I have had this phone for a few months and I am so happy. For the price and quality you can't go wrong. Also battery life is amazing, I have not charged my phone since 7:00 am and it is now 11:00pm and I am still at 50%. I use me phone alot so this to me is the best selling point of this phone.... Oh and it charges sooooo fast. If you're looking to not break the bank and have a great phone I highly recommend the huawei.",5,,

This is my second Huawei, had the first one for 2 years and the only reason I decided to change it is cause it was super slow for obvious reasons. I was thinking on getting an iPhone even though I'm not a fan of apple but at the end what made me decide for the Huawei was the screen. In the two years I had my last phone, I dropped it countless times and nothing ever happened, so that was it for me.
After 2 months I accidentally dropped my Huawei p20 lite (with a case on), and the screen is completely shattered... Like bad, this never happened to any of the phones I had before. So here I am feeling like an iPhone owner with a shattered screen. The area where the front camera is, is shattered too, depending on the light I can take nice or decent pictures.
Besides that, the phone is okay, no lagging after 2 months of use. The camera during day time is pretty good but if you're using it at night or without good light conditions is terrible.

*Update: Now the main camera is shattered too and I don't even know how! I'm so frustrated, I really regret spending my money on this phone!! Could blame the case but it's the same style of case I used for my previous phone and it was never a problem!!",3,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/HUAWEI-Display-Factory-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07CMBB6PH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews

When i contacted the seller and asked about the fast charging, they told me to contact the phone manufacturer. They were trying to avoid helping me solve the issue. I had a lot going on and didnt have the time to return the phone.

Pros:
Phone doesnt lag and works pretty good for the price
Fingerprint and  Face unlock works really well
Screen quality is good

Cons:
Camera is not that great. Had a Xiaomi Mi5s before and the camera was so much better.
Does NOT support 5Ghz wifi network
Will need a case if you like fingerprints on your phone
Takes way too long to charge!!",3,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/HUAWEI-Display-Factory-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07CMBB6PH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews

My wife and I replaced our old Samsung Galaxy Express 3 with P20 Lite (pink for my wife and blue for myself). Major problems of the Galaxy devices were 1. it had only 8GB RAM which kept us from installing apps after a few and 2. the performance was getting slower over a few years. These two combined irritated us significantly and we decided to buy new ones that were less than $500 a piece with at least 32 GB memory. We both are casual users of smartphones, so we didn't need high-end lineups of Samsung and others.

Overall, we are very happy with the phones and assured that we wouldn't need more expensive devices. Below are a couple of tips that future buyers may want to know in advanace.

1. Replacing SIM from the Galaxy devices to P20 Lite phones was quite easy. We live in North Carolina, USA and we are users of AT&T Prepaid. So, we stopped by an AT&T store. The sales person did it quickly. He also kindly replaced the 32GB external SD card from the Galaxy devices to Huawei's for us. The phones started working instantly. I guess you could do it yourself.

2. The phone looks super sleek. It's slightly thinner and lighter than the Galaxy device. It's longer in height but still fits in wife's and my hand very well. The blue and pink colors both look fantastic.

3. The 32GB storage is large enough for us. I have installed several apps that I wanted to use but couldn't with the Galaxy device and the phone still has almost 14GB remaining.

4. The performance is wonderful.

5. The camera is way more amazing than we expected. It takes pictures that would look like those taken by a pro even inside the home at night. Now I really think my wife no longer needs a compact digital camera. There are a lot of nice features such as panoramic shots, pictures with a blurred background that look taken by a DSLR camera (I have a Nikon D7200).

There are a couple of small cons.

1. Some of the pre-installed apps are less sophisticated than those in the Galaxy device. For example, the interface for setting time in Calendar and Clock apps are very old fashion. You have to scroll, say, from 0, 1, 2 to 28, 29, 30 minutes. Notepad is OK but one thing I miss is that I can't add a title which I could with the Galaxy's. The Galaxy's had a nice Visual voicemail app but the Huawei's does not. Pre-installed Huawei apps may not work in the US. For example, when I open AppGallery, it says ""unavailable in this country/region"". Since I don't use them, it's not a big problem, anyway.

2. This may not be a problem of the Huawei device but a problem of Android 8. Anyway, when I connect the device to my HONDA CR-V (2013) via bluetooth, the song info is not refreshed after one or a few songs were played. It may be the issue of AVRCP but I can't find a way to downgrade AVRCP as someone suggested online.

3. This is not an issue of P20 Lite itself but I have a CASHIO G-SHOCK with a radio controlled time adjustment feature. It seems this feature is disturbed by P20 Lite device. It was used working with the Galaxy device but since I got P20 Lite phone, the G-SHOCK fails to adjust the time when the phone is placed nearby.

Now I know there is a political issue between Huawei and western countries including my home country Japan. I don't want to touch on this in this review. Only thing I hope is that the issue is solved peacefully and Huawei phones can keep available over the world as they are such excellent products.

EDIT:
Regarding #3 above, it turned out that placing the device a little bit behind my G-SHOCK does solve the issue. My watch has to sit facing toward the window. When the device is placed near the watch and closer to the window than the watch, it would disturb the radio controlled time adjustment. But when it is placed farther from the window than the watch even if both sit next each other, the time adjustment seems to work fine.",5,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/HUAWEI-Display-Factory-Unlocked-Smartphone/product-reviews/B07CMBB6PH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews

Constant loop,"Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2018","Alright. I'm going to give it to you straight. I did not like the service (From Huawei, Amazon did pretty good in giving me a refund). I bought the phone it had a delivery date. Didn't show up on delivery date and delivery date moved to another date (at least 3 days) didn't arrive on that either. Filed a refund and well I got it. Reordered the same phone. Came next day. I got it and tried setting it up. Then when it booted up the logo would appear the screen would dim to Black and the logo would appear again. Did this a couple of time until I tried hard resetting, I factory reset it. IT DID NOT WORK AT ALL. I sent it back and got a refund. From Amazon not from Huawei. I reordered it again. And as of right now same situation. It felt like they just resent the same broken phone twice. I honestly got nothing else to say besides avoid trying to buy the phone. If you do that's fine, if it doesn't work send it back and get a refund from Amazon. Also make sure the phone is new (mine was supposedly new, felt like a cheap old broken one). If you never get the phone get an Amazon associate to mark it as lost and get a refund. IDK why I had this many problems for a defective product? But I did and now y'all know. Try it out is all I can say but just be cautious. I tried the phone again today Nov,5th 2018 and I thought I got the problem figured but I guess I was wrong. It kept rebooting and wouldn't stop.

I highly recommend getting a case beforehand bc it is fairly slippery. The overall look of even the lock screen highly resembles an iPhone X so that's nice, it's also very customizable. In addition it has facial recognition which works amazingly. Oddly though, if you go into trusted CA or whatever in your security option, you will be met by either companies or research centers who are able to in a way moniter your phone. I joke you not, *Japanese Government * is literally one of those options. I ran through and turned off tons of those options bc they either involved international governments or businesses. Overall a great phone, but if your privacy really matters to you, be careful with this phone. Also, as mentioned in the headline it does work with GSM carriers.

However, as others have stated - no 5GHz is a bit annoying (we've disabled all 2.4GHz at work due to interference with wireless headsets).

Also, it's slippery! It slid out of my pocket within the first few hours of me receiving it. I should have bought a case before using the phone, as now I've got giant cracks front/rear of this phone.

Slow processor.,"Reviewed in the United States on June 16, 2019","I bought this phone around 4 or 5 months ago and it's a pretty nice mid range phone. This sakura pink color looks a lot better in person. It's a bit lighter than what the renders show. It also has a glittery effect. I love the design and it has some pretty great cameras too. The selfie cam is probably one of the best I've used in a while and you can even do bokeh effect on it. Low light shots are pretty decent on both front and back cameras. My only gripe about the phone is the processor. It will stutter and lag for about 3 seconds. It already froze on me a couple of times to the point of where I had to reset it. EMUI isn't the best launcher either but of course you can cha ge that by downloading a launcher from the play store.  After the April security update, gesture navigation is also enabled so you won't have to use the on screen soft keys to navigate around the phone.

If it wasn't for the huawei ban, I'd definitely recommend this phone. It's uncertain whether or not this phone will get the EMUI 9/Android Pie update so it's still stuck on oreo.

EDIT: It looks like the battery has been draining a lot quicker than before.

There are a few things I decided to leave iPhoneX:
1. iPhoneX is way too thick than expexted , especially when you use a case.
2. And it's too heavy, I don't understand why apple makes such a heavy thing, compaing iPhone6 I was using.
3. The face id is horrible. I ware a glass at daytime but not in bed, and I turn off lights when using phone.  Face id fails 9 out 10 to unlock.

I have decided to use P30 instead of my iPhoneX two weeks ago, and feel good till now.
The P30 Crystall (light blue) one is really beautiful, and amazing, there are a few reasons why I'm using it instead of iPhoneX:
1. It's supper thin!!!!
2. It's supper light weighted!!!
3. Supper beautiful, my goodness! The back glass is gorgeous!
4. It has a narrow and long screen comparing to iPhoneX, better look and feel then iPhoneX.
5. I had concern about my privacy, but I ended up find out that I don't have to because I mostly use Google service, and all my data in Huawei account is stored in Ireland, it is protected by Ireland's law instead of Chinese law.
6. AWESOME camera! Comparing with iPhoneX, it has better pictures in dark, and similar quality under sunlight outside.

I don't have an iPhoneXS or XR, so no comments on that.",5,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/ELE-L29-Factory-Unlocked-Smartphone-International/product-reviews/B07Q2X19LG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews

I took one star off because some features made me feel uncomfortable. 1st. it has limited capacity for US user. I cannot register Huawei ID because the US is not in the country list so I cannot access such as Huawei AppGallery and anything that require Huawei ID. 2nd, many Huawei apps state clearly on the privacy policy that Huawei will collect  private information such as birthday. If I choose decline, then apps became not acceptable. I concerned pretty a lot on this because I have no idea how they will use my private information.",4,,

Still in the exploration state but to date, I can say the following:

Setup was pretty straightforward, transfer of my data from another phone was made easy using 'Phone Clone'. There are other features provided for transferring data from other types of phones as well. Google assistant is a welcome perk for me, that definitely works and makes getting acquainted with my phone easier.

I chose the fast charger as a part of my purchase with the phone and it definitely charges up the phone faster than usual, and the phone keeps charge longer than the norm, even with the Bluetooth on and the transfer of data.

The camera takes fantastic pictures that shows an explosion of colors that makes an amateur photographer looks and feel like a pro. The camera and video features available on the Huawei P30 make taking pictures and videos a dream. I have to constantly take my phone from my son because he keeps using it to take pics and videos even though he has his own phone.

Playing music or doing recordings is great with the added features to make you play music like you are in a club or throwing a party. Oh, the option to have the lyrics show on the home screen while the song is playing is simply dope...

I've only heard about them they do not sell this phone or similar models anywhere around Albany New York. I have heard great things about this phone and the Google pixel 3 XL if your looking for quality but at a value price. I personally own a Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus and with the newest update now has a camera night mode. I'm very happy with it, you can zoom up around 8x-10x using a smaller screen ratio, It looks pretty good for a smartphone. I've tried the new night mode taking a picture of my car in the dark and I do notice a difference it's brighter and more colorful then on auto. The S10 Plus is a bit expensive but I would never go with the less expensive S10 models to save a few bucks. This phone is definitely worth the extra money. But It is hard for me to believe that for any phone no matter the company that a smartphone camera at 50x looks clear. Any company can claim you can zoom in 100x which will probably happen in the future, but does it mean it will actually come out sharp and clear?",4,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/ELE-L29-Factory-Unlocked-Smartphone-International/product-reviews/B07Q2X19LG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews

I have been looking at the flagship phones - Huawei p30 pro, p30, Samsung s10E, S10, S10+ and even the Samsung s9+, I've looked at the side by sides and the Huawei wins. Here's why -

1. Huawei has the bigger battery, (battery run tests show in order of phones dying after same usage: 6. Samsung 10e, 5. Samsung S10, 4. Samsung S9+ 3. Huawei p30. 2. Huawei p30 Pro. 1. Samsung S10+. This was a bit of a shocker because I thought Huawei pro has a bigger battery than the 10+, but the test showed better performance by the Samsung.

2. Price - The Huawei p30 pro and the Samsung 10+ are are both out of my price range. The only major difference between the p30 Pro and the P30 is the P30 pro has wireless charging (which replaces a headphone jack), a bigger camera sensor, superior telephoto lens, bigger battery, and better display. For me - I don't personally like huge phones that don't fit in my pocket, I also don't like the 300 dollar price difference, I furthermore don't care about wireless charging, AND I really want a headphone jack. So for me - the P30, the S10 and the S10e made more sense to buy.

3. Now when it comes to photos, the results are very mixed. For the price, the Samsung s9+ is the best camera/price combo out of all of these, the difference between the S9+ and the S10 are very minimal to me. The colors look more true on the S9 than the S10s for some reason. There's a youtube video comparing these cameras in low-light conditions and even I was shocked that I (along with others who saw the video) picked the S9+ over the S10s.

(But again, i dont like bulky phones, so s9+ is out)

HOWEVER, the Huawei p30 and p30 pro low-light camera is INDUSTRY LEADING, better than the S10, better than the Pixel 3 (Although Pixel 3 has more true-to-life colors), and Apple (is not even worth a mention here tbh, it's so sad how far they have fallen behind, and how dumb their followers truly are - sorry Apple fans).

So because of price, I narrowed it down to the Samsung 10e and the Huawei p30. The Huawei p30 is cheaper that the 10e, which really makes it a no brainer for me. (Right now, the S10E with student discount is $634 (with tax) on Samsung website) and P30 is 599 here and other websites (do your research) with no tax. The p30 has better battery, faster charging, better looks, and superior low-light performance than the S10E - So it's a no brainer I am opting the buy the P30.

Added comment 1 wk post-purchase:

1. The Huawei product is not a product of the Chinese government, that's a rumor started in the USA, and only in the USA. I believe it's used to protect Apple's share in the market. US could potentially be Huawei's biggest market, but trade war stuff and politics prevents the US government from allowing Huawei phones to be carried by major carriers. Europe, Canada, Latin America and Asia all have Huawei phones, zero countries have discovered any sort of spying hardware or software. The company itself will overtake Samsung or so as the 2nd largest phone company in the world. I did my research thoroughly and stand firm on the results. Any comments to the contrary is either under-researched or not researched.

But as a precaution - Huawei ID does ask for access to your information (same as Samsung, same as Apple ID) I opted out of joining the Huawei ID and have no problems - by the way you can't do this on an Apple.

2. Low light amazingness only happens when you take pictures in 40 mp, at 10 mp, the performance is similar to my Samsung s7 edge. Yes, the low light performance is amazing. As expected, daylight pictures are a little cooler than the Samsung photos I've taken.

3. I don't like how all the apps are on your home screen, so I put them all in folders on a third home screen and never scroll there.

4. This phone doesn't have wireless charging, so also by default - no reverse wireless charging. The p30 Pro has that capability.

5. Holy crap this phone is fast - no Google maps load time, faster load times on games than Samsung s10s, when you're on Google maps and you take a wrong turn, the phone immediately recalculates route and gives you new directions, this is especially important when you're in a rush and are looking up directions somewhere, my old Samsung s7 drove me nuts with the load times, and I've missed secondary turns from direction reloading. I got lost in an Uber going to the airport before due to this issue, Uber driver had to pull off to the shoulder for my map to load because her map wasn't showing directions properly. I am relieved this will never happen again.

6. Battery life performance was great as expected - I'm a heavy user and get to 39% at the end of the night. This is super important because when you go out, you have the capacity to take a bunch of pictures, even after all day (heavy) use. This would never happen on an Apple or Samsung phone of equivalent size.

7. P30 uses new technology for your ear, it's not a speaker. It's some sort of ultrasonic vibration. I've heard reviews of it not working as well as the speakers but I found this unfounded, I've noticed no difference in sound quality of calls. However, I did notice differences when the other person put me on speaker. Sometimes they sound really muffled. This problem only existed when i called friends in california (2x this happened with 2 different people)

8. The operating system took zero time for me to learn, some things this phone does better than Apple, some it doesn't. Apple IOS is still Imo, most intuitive. I've had zero issues with app compatibility since p30 runs android. I ran into one problem with  Whatsapp and thought it was a compatibility issue, turns out it was a permission I didn't give the app. Problem solved in no time.

I will continue to update this review over time.

3 weeks post purchase - the p30 has a problem with the fingerprint sensor going on and off every 10 seconds. This has been a wide ranging problem as seen on the Huawei forums. The US officially banned Huawei (along with Australia, Japan and Taiwan) but the list of countries that don't ban Huawei (because of the potential 5g rollout) includes: most of Europe since Vodafone publically defends Huawei, India, Vietnam, most of South America, Russia, Philippines, South Korea, Thailand, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Indonesia.

As of 6/27/19 - the fingerprint issue has been fixed, but Google no longer will support Huawei devices. I am not 100% clear how this will affect the phone but the plus side is this trade war might be over soon, once that's all done this phone is a steal. I did a comparison with the Pixel 3 night time, and had minimal difference, my phone did pick up some colors better, definitely better exposure, but completely missed the light purple colors for some reason at night (it comes out as blue) . If that's your favorite color for some reason, you might not want to pick this over the pixel 3.

Update 10/1/19 - Trade war still happening, nothing has happened to Google Play store, or any andriod feature. Since Google announced they won't be supporting Huawei, Huawei has declared to build their own operating system, so that should be interesting. This phone battery never dies, not once has this phone ever died because of battery. I've timed it so I charge my phone at work every day or so. When I take this phone out of the little case, the aurura blue is still gorgeous. People think it's the Apple 11 lmao. The 40 megapixel makes drop dead gorgeous 8 x 10 photos which Wal Mart Photo develops nicely. (I've done my research on this, don't go to CVS, Walgreens, etc their photo machines and print quality are trash). No issues with not registering Huawei ID. Zero compatibility issues with apps. This is probably my last update until major changes happen with the trade war or Huawei rolls out with a new operating system. Thanks for the likes!",5,,

I exclusively used iPhone for the past 5 years and recently switched to the Huawei Mate 20 Pro after my iPhone screen cracked and ran out of memory space. I've been unimpressed by Apple's lack of innovation in recent years and decided to try the mate 20 Pro after doing a lot of research and reading a lot of reviews.
This phone lives up to the hype and has exceeded all of my expectations! The camera is amazing, the resolution of the screen is beautiful, and the operating system took a little getting used to but the EMUI skin that Huawei utilises seems to be slightly inspired by iOS. I haven't noticed any of the green screen bleed that some people mention and I also can't attest to the overall security of the phone (alleged Chinese malware and spying). This phone is honestly so amazing that even if the spying allegations are true I'd still own/use this phone!",5,,

However, I took a risk because of the great reviews that this phone had. If you ask me what are the most important things of the Huawei Mate 20 Pro, I would say that they are:
1. Battery life: the battery lasts almost 48 full hours.
2. Incredible photos: the quality of the photos is undeniable.
3. Where is my phone?: The Smart Assistance feature allows me to find my phone if I left it somewhere in my house and I cannot find it. I always lose it, so this feature is super useful!
4. Great themes and tones! Also, the Eye Comfort feature is something wonderful.
5. Its curved screen gives a better definition and is truly beautiful.
Not so great things:
1. The video quality is good, but there are other phones with better video quality.
2. The audio quality is not the best (it's good, do not misunderstand me, but there are competitors with something better).
3. Does not have the traditional entrance for headphones; so you can only use the ones that the phone brings that connect by USB or use wireless.
4. The face recognition feature (in my opinion) is not so effective. 90% of the times doesn't recognize me.
In general, I do not regret my purchase. So far the Huawei Mate 20 Pro has proven to be a genius device.",5,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Huawei-Mate-LYA-L29-128GB-International/product-reviews/B07K1M36CM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews

Contrary to ""light leaking"" and glue gate claims, the model I received is fine. So there are no issues to report regarding that. I'm in the US on AT&T. No issues with coverage whatsoever. Ok, onto the pros and cons.

Pros:
- Battery life: Absolutely the best on any smartphone right now. I easily get around 35 hours (moderate to heavy usage on YouTube, Instagram, FB). I've had the iPhone XS Max, Pixel 3 XL, Samsung S9+, etc and with this phone, I don't feel the need to search for an outlet.
- Super fast charging: this is on par with the OnePlus, if not better with 40w charging. 70% in 30mins is factual - I have tried it myself.
- Form factor: I have smaller hands but the 6.3"" screen in this frame is a joy to handle. Easier to hold than a Note 9.
- Camera: You won't get a perfect shot everytime like the Pixel 2/3 series but the versatility of lenses is unmatched in 2019. The wide, telephoto, and 5x hybrid zoom are fun to play with and sharp. You just need to play with all the modes depending on what you're capturing. There are many modes to choose from. I'd rate this camera just behind the and Pixel 3 but ahead of the iPhone X's.
- Gestures: You can maximize screen real estate by using screen gestures similar to the iPhone X's. Love this btw. No need for the usual 3 nav buttons.
- IR blaster
- Desktop mode mirroring onto your smart tv (similar to Samsung Dex but totally wireless)

Cons:
- Notifications: they do not always display on the lockscreen (which is odd). Kind of a bummer but not a deal breaker.
- Vibration motor: iPhone X is still King in this department. Huawei's is a tad weak.
- Carrier availability: not sold in US.

Overall: this is a true beast of a phone. It's a shame Americans don't have a chance to experience this powerhouse jam-packed with features. With outstanding battery life and super fast charging, amazing camera, great form factor, gorgeous screen, this is truly worth every penny you pay for.",5,,

The most impresive from it is the battery life, and camera, no other phone i had before gets close to it ( iPhone X, S9+, PocoPhone). The main reason i got it was because of the camera, and im still really impressed with it, the pictures it takes are really great. The other main factor is the battery life, i can easly get 2 days of battery life doing the same things i did with the iPhone X and S9+ ( used to get on those 2 phones around 10 hours of battery life ).

The only disadvantage you can get with this phone is the sound on speaker mode if you are a speaker sound guy, better get an iPhone which has a louder sound. But for me, and normal use no need at all.

There's a bunch of maybe apps and they throw in some others like Facebook which is annoying but given the storage isn't an issue. Main problem I found is if you're using Google service the native photo email and messaging app will get in the road where they will still act as defaults so to send a photo you need to go in to photo and send it from there instead of doing in the messages app , pure Android on these would be perfect
The fingerprint reader can be hinky but the face recognition is quick although I'm not sure how secure it is .
Bluetooth can be problematic but I've switched to a pixel phone and some of the connection problems still exist.
Screen protectors can be a problem I've had them fall off when you drop the phone so it pays to have spares.
Can't fault the camera but I did miss the dedicated black and white sensor that was on the 10.
These are IMHO the best looking phones around but they are slippery in the hand so you end up covering them in plastic which is a shame",4,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Huawei-Mate-LYA-L29-128GB-International/product-reviews/B07K1M36CM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews

1.Turn off the Sim and turn on the wifi then do a software update...
2.buy a Hong Kong Sim, so the one I brought was supposed to be pre.activated and should have work in roaming but it did but once the car is in and wifi is activated it work instantly if it is on automatic update it will update instantly without any help...

Unfortunately, there were software issues (hopefully they are gone now). The phone came in Chinese and already set-up, which is really odd. Had to Google how to change it to English and then everything was fine for a few hours until the phone somehow forgot my pin. Had to then Google how to factory reset it, which took several attempts because the phone kept stating that the software installation failed and that I needed to see tech support online. Finally got it to factory reset, then complete an actual set-up, and it seems to be working fine now, and not forgetting my PIN. I was literally on the verge of returning this phone because of all the software malfunctions it had within hours of me receiving it. Hopefully I don't ultimately need to.

1.) Works completely fine with AT&T
2.) No green screen issue whatsoever

Every review, especially those from Europe and Asia, led me to buy this phone.  I figured that if the Europeans with their tough privacy and cyber security laws, and the savvy Asian tech shoppers from Singapore and Hong Kong like this phone so much, I was going to give it a try.  I figured Huawei overtook Apple to become the second largest smartphone brand in the world for a reason.
I have had this phone now for a week.  I can say that I am surprised that I am using it over my (new very fast Macbook pro) lap top for the first time.  This phone is very fast and has very sharp images.  The wifi and LTE reception are super compared to a dozen of other units in my household -- a true pleasure to use.  I work in hospitals that require me to log into the hospital computers no matter where I am to review detailed, often urgent and complex cases that often contain large image files.  Patient confidentiality is also a big cyber issue.  Up to this point, I could never do that with a cell phone nor even on a high resolution IPad.  With this phone, with its amazing speed and QHD resolution, I am finally able to give up my laptop.  The facial recognition, the  thumb print entry features on top of pass codes are reassuring.
This phone came with a very nice ""tips"" icon.  I have only tried out a few of their amazing artificial intelligence features.  They actually worked.  I was shock that you can point the camera at any document in any language and get it translated instantly into any other language in the world.  The camera images are truly amazing  -- very very sharp, telephoto lens...!
So far, smoothly running all my google apps, investment apps, audible, Netflix ... -- no complaints at all.",5,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Huawei-Mate-LYA-L29-128GB-International/product-reviews/B07K1M36CM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews

Yamane,"Most Impressive Smartphone of 2018, period! No exassuration!","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2018","I am a mobile app programmer, and have dozens of both Android and iOS devices out of necessity. As I have been doing this for some time (since 2011), I am quite jaded when it comes to smartphones and for the last several years, have not been at all excited about new flagship smartphones that have come out. I am, however, pleasantly surprised and excited enough to write a quick review on this Huawei Mate 20 Pro.

First off, I do not work for Huawei or any device manufacturer. Second, I was lucky to get a unit that does not have the screen bleed issue that some users apparently have unfortunately, from the first shipments of the device. I have now used my Mate 20 Pro as my daily driver for a full work week, and actually enjoy picking it up and using it, like when these type of devices first came out.

Some things that are notable and what stands out----

(a) The phone is noticeably fast... actually very fast. I know it's got the latest and greatest 8-core Kirin 980 processor, but until you use it for daily activities, you don't realize the difference from other devices. Example: I can scroll through a Facebook or Instagram feed very fast, while every video is *playing back* in each post with no stuttering or glitching. Any button I tap, or app I start instantly loads up, and is addictive to see everything respond so quickly.

(b) Something about the screen is very very sharp. I keep mine at the full 3120x1440 WQHD+ resolution, and for some reason, it seems sharper and brighter than other flagship phones I had as my daily driver this year including the LG G7, iPhone X and the Huawei Mate 10 Pro.

(c) The 4200 mah battery is incredible. Example: I'll go to sleep with the phone fully charged. I'll use my phone all day as usual, and by the time I go to sleep, it's still at 56% or so battery left. This is with watching Youtube videos, listening to music, emails, Facebook, Instagram, testing my apps and the usual. Also, it has this 'reverse' wireless charging feature, and my friends trip out when I take my iPhone X, and place it on top of the Mate 20 Pro and it starts charging!

(d) The in-screen finger print scanner is something else. It has this cool bright blue/white flash for a second when it reads my finger and it logs me in instantly. I've also got the face recognition turned on so I have both, and its novelty is still amusing 6 days in.

(e) The build quality is top notch. It feels like I have a very premium device, as it should, having paid $1049 for it. Well worth the money.

(f) The ability to clone apps (i.e. have 2 Facebook apps, each logged in with a different account), as well as completely cloning your phone, so there's a completely separate copy (like a dual boot PC) is very cool for a device of this calibre. Very useful when testing environment needs are different than what my daily driver settings are.

(g) The 3 cameras main cameras, the 40mp main, 20mp ultra wide angle, and 8mp telephoto work very very well. I have been partial to LG phones for a while because they were the only ones with the wide angle camera, but now that this flagship Huawei has it, I'm sticking with the Huawei now.

(h) I have a pair of some wireless bluetooth Sony WM-1000XM3 headphones that I use with it, and the audio is incredible. This of course may just be the headphones themselves, but I got both at the same time.

(i) Everything is just incredibly fast on this device, so it makes you want to touch every app, tinker with it, etc. just because everything comes up instantaneously.

I realize the U.S. Intelligence agencies warn against Huawei devices because of suspected ties to the Chinese government, but as a random civilian user with nothing really to hide, I have to say this is an excellent device and really shows Chinese hardware makers have upped their game to the top of the global food chain. I highly recommend it for those who don't mind spending money for quality products.

p.s. As a final note, I do not use the Huawei ID, nor created an account. I just use only my Google Account with it, so I may not be getting all the frills that come with that, but even without, it blows away all other devices I've had this year by a wide margin.",5,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Huawei-Mate-LYA-L29-128GB-International/product-reviews/B07K1M36CM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews

The design is stunning. I got the emerald green and man does it stand out. Who rocks a green phone?? It last long due to large battery and charges super fast with it's original charger. The back cameras take amazing pictures with great dynamic range and detail. As well as low light pictures come out good in most conditions that's not near pitch black. Video is good also but i wish it did 4k 60fps, it only does 30fps. Front camera is not great it does skin smoothing too heavily I can't seem to find a way to turn it off. Im not a selfie whore so it doesn't bother me much. For a tall phone it feels good in the hand but one hand typing is out of the question. I don't like the software UI and it came with so much bloatware, luckily i installed the pixel launcher and you can uninstall 90% of useless apps it came with. Mostly my experience has been more than amazing with this phone and would recommend it but it's not easy to get here in the U.S.

Also the seller added a US power adapter free of charge, it comes with a Euro charger in the box and i was ready purchase one. Very greatful for that. My unit luckily didn't come with the LG screen otherwise i would have returned it.",5,,

I upgraded from an iPhone 6s that I had for two years.  I wanted a new phone and I was sick and tiered of Apple playing mind games with its overly loyal customers while Chinese companies like Huawei are releasing next level phone technology at reasonable prices. I bothered to go to the apple store and try out every single new iPhone they had testing the camera and how images looked and I was very disappointed at how little apples cameras and screen rez has changed since the 6s for most of their phones. If I wanted a decent apple phone camera I would have to shell out nearly 1k for a phone which I refuse to do. So I did some research online and found the Huawei, which I had never previously heard of, was a darling amongst tech reviewers. Now that I have it in my hands I can see why. On the one hand I like having a phone that most people don't have but I also feel obliged to say if you are still with apple please leave the cult and buy a phone from a company that sees its customers as valuable and intelligent. Apple thinks you are stupid and will charge you for just the aesthetics of a phone that is lacking in features.

I paid for fast shipping and it came on schedule. I got the emerald green because the twilight is too showy and corful for me, this is a great classy color with depth. The few areas for improvement on this phone are ones I knew about before buying and that is the face unlock and fingerprint scanner, they lag and are not as smooth and swift as on other devices, this is mostly just annoying when driving but I guess all more reason to stay focused on the road. And another random problem I have is that I haven't been able to use split screen with my knuckles yet, but that may be due to my screen protector.",5,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Huawei-Mate-LYA-L29-128GB-International/product-reviews/B07K1M36CM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews

Easy to use. Face unlock, fingerprint scanner and latest Android update. Feels light weight compared to my Honor 7x.

Her previous phone a Xiaomi Mia1 could barely get a full bar or connect to LTE.

For starters, the battery life is incredible. With heavy use (games like Hearthstone and lots of YouTube) I can easily come out the other side of my 12 hour shift with 15-20% left. If you do have to charge it though, the supplied charger puts out 4.5A @ 5V and will get you several more hours of use in no time flat.

The fingerprint sensor is something else that is unbelievably fast. Almost the instant you touch the well placed sensor the phone is unlocked. I loved how fast the sensor is on my Nexus 6P which is also a Huawei built phone, but this one is in a whole other ballpark as far as speed is concerned.

Another thing I like about it is the stereo speakers. I loved the ones in my 6P and was hugely disappointed in the sad, lone speaker Google put on my Pixel XL. This phone uses the single bottom firing speaker while in portrait mode but uses both when in landscape and is more than adequate for showing your co-workers the latest video you found of Panda bears falling over and over again.

The camera is another area that Huawei made sure was done right. Pictures turn out great with no effort and only get better with all the options they give you. Same goes for videos, there are a total of 9 different modes of video that go from tiny MMS size videos to 4k @ 30 fps, along with 1080p @ 60 & 120 fps, and 720p @ 240 fps.

Now that I've brought up the Pixel XL that I attempted to replace my 6P with I want to say something about how these phones feel in your hand. The 6P and the Mate 10 Pro both feel as expensive as they are. The Pixel XL feels like the cheap plastic toys you get with the tickets at Chuck E Cheese. It's a minor point to most I'm sure but if I'm spending $800+ on a phone I want to feel like my money is well spent.

As for the things I don't like. My main gripe is the display. Yes, under most circumstances it's a great screen even though the resolution isn't as high as other flagship phones. There are really only a few instances where its lower resolution shows itself, and the main one where I notice it is in the game Hearthstone. When your cards are low in your hand the card art is pretty distorted looking. When you bring them up to take a closer look they are much better looking. On the 6P and Pixel XL the card art is nice and sharp all the time.

The other complaint I have is of course the lack of a headphone jack. We've all got our own opinions and I'm on the side that misses it. If Samsung can make an IP68 rated phone with a headphone jack then Huawei should be able to as well. But of course them and Google are too busy worrying about what Apple is doing. We don't need thinner phones that make it easier to bend/break these expensive phones, and I'd much rather have the jack than the IR blaster they included.",5,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Huawei-Unlocked-Processor-Camera-Resistant/product-reviews/B078T2T2FL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews

Get yourself a Mate 10 Pro!! you will be glad you did!!!,"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2018","have had IPhones since the Iphone 4. this thing blows iphones away!!!
great picture!
great camera!
and great sound!
its super fast and works on T Mobile a lot better than any of my old iphones ever did!
it feels good in my hand or in my pocket, its not too big nor is it too small, its just damn right!
Huawei has a new customer for life!! thank you so much for bringing it to the US!!

the only negative thing i can think of at this moment is so far im having a hard time finding a good case that i like the look of for it. i ordered one and when it came in it was just cheap feeling and didn't fit right. i had my eye on 3 others that were a bit more expensive but they are all out of stock now.. just my luck.  i used Lunatik for my iphones but i don't think they are even in business any more.. may have to check them out and see if they still are and make a case for the Mate 10 Pro.

quick edit... forgot to mention the battery life. now granted i don't use my phone as a computer like most people do..i don't sit around and surf the internet with it, i don't have a tun of games i play all day long... that being said compared to my iphone the Mate 10 Pro's battery life is much better. doing the same things i normally do in a day i used way less battery than i would on my iphone. by the time i got home from work today i think i was sitting at 95% charge if not more. on my iphone it would be at 50% or less... usually less.

thank you again Huawei for bringing the Mate 10 Pro to the US!!!

Update nearly a year later.... Still going strong and battery life is amazing, i can usually go 2 days without charging.  Customer support is also amazing, most helpful and quick to respond and very helpful they even CALLED me a few days later to check to make sure everything was working correctly and if i have had any more problems. so the people saying customer service is horrible must have used the wrong thing or are not telling the truth because i have never had such great customer service before.  the problem i had was i had turned something off in the settings or disabled something and it wasn't able to download its updates. so the problem i had with it was a user error problem he he.

Also wanted to note that my work phone also got upgraded to a samsung note 9... the Mate 10 Pro still blows that thing out of the water. picture quality is better on the Mate 10, sound quality also better on Mate 10, now i have better coverage on my Mate 10 on T Mobile than i do with the note 9 on verison but that might just be because T Mobile is better than verison.. i don't really know about that part. Battery life is WAY better on the Mate 10 as well... the note is sitting at 48% at the end of the day when i get home from work and i have not used it at all for anything not even looking at email or sending a text just sitting there doing nothing and its at 48% not sure if its because of bloat ware or what but my Mate 10 is sitting at 90% and i actually use it to check personal email and to send texts.

All in all i really love this phone. it has held up great this past year and i would recommend this phone to anyone wanting to upgrade and or just wanting a new nice phone.  i have been telling my friend he needs to get one of these but he decided to go with a different one forget what it was but now he is regretting it after 6 months and he actually asked me what it was that i had and i think he is going to finally take my advice and get a Mate 10 Pro.

Once again thank you Huawei for bringing the Mate 10 Pro to America!",5,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Huawei-Unlocked-Processor-Camera-Resistant/product-reviews/B078T2T2FL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_41?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=41&reviewerType=all_reviews

The Mate 10 Pro is everything I was looking for in a phone, it is large, has a lightning fast processor, amazing dual camera, nice and quick fingerprint scanner, very good on board sound quality which switches between mono and stereo sound as you rotate the phone between landscape and portrait, and so much more! Also something to note, I have no quarrels at all with EMUI! I have read reviews that knock it but I cannot understand why, I quite enjoy it.
!!! Important Note !!! This phone does not have a 3.5mm audio jack! This is not an issue at all for me because it comes with an adaptor for the lovely usb type c charging port so you can still use 3.5mm audio devices, it comes with a pair of earbuds that have actually quite good sound quality as well.
I am absolutely overjoyed with this phone, and don't worry about charging it!

I received my unit yesterday (Feb 20th), and went to AT&T store immediately, they were able to
set it up quickly and copy over contact and other info from my old phone. Then I noticed that it has no LTE or 4G signal.
The employee at AT&T store was not able to figure out why there is no mobile data network. The phone can receive and make calls, and SMS message also works, but just no internet. After about 1 hour, they gave up, and told me to contact Huawei. That was around 4PM. I went home and contact Huawei right away, the CS agent (her name is Marisa) spend close to 2 hours with me, trying out various stuff, including couple of factory reset, which wipes out stuff I moved over from old phone, still no connection. Wifi works, but just no internet. The option to enable 4G under mobile network menu couldn't be set to enable. They checked the IEMI number, everything seems to check out. In the end, she said to wait 24 hours, maybe it takes a little while for the new SIM card to register. Then I found the review on this site by ""Ancher"". I actually print out his review and took it with me when I visited AT&T store again. They were not sure what to take of that, but to their credit, they were willing to try the method mentioned by ""Ancher"". One of their employee swap my SIM card with his iPhone8's. Both were able to connect to LTE quickly, we played around with some website for a short while, then switched the SIM cards back, and just like I have hoped, my Mate 10 Pro suddenly had no problem with connecting to 4G LTE network.

The phone is beautiful, and camera is amazing, but I wish I didn't have to go through this to get it to work. In the end, neither AT&T, nor Huawei was able to fix the problem. It was the power of internet and user community that came through.",4,,

4. Much, much stronger signal, especially the wifi.
5. it comes with the installed screen protector and phone case.
6. setup on this phone is much easier than iPhone. I just need to search on the phone instead of google for it.
I also took couple photos and they look better than iPhone too.

My galaxy S3 just got so slow that I couldn't even take a picture on it without waiting 3+ minutes for the phone to respond. With the mate 10, I just put my finger over the fingerprint scanner and boom everything loads so fast, and the camera on this thing takes such high resolution photos everyone is blown away when they see the pics I've taken.

I wanted to hold out for another 12 months and get the Mate 20 or whatever they will call it but when the price of this dropped to $650, i couldn't wait.

The screen looks much better over the mate 9. The OLED display is just very rich and crisp.
The camera is a major improvement in low light shots over the mate 9.

Not happy about headphone jack being gone, but this seems to be the new direction.
Not thrilled about no expandable storage. 128gb is plenty though so this is ok.

Overall, this feels like a nice upgrade from the mate 9. I wouldn't have paid $800 for it, but at $650, I am happy.
Excited to get the new AI features of the P20 later this year in an update.

Just an update. I have really enjoyed this device. It is getting consistently 8+ hours of screen on time and usually lasts a couple of days on charge. I am getting used to the EMUI software although I would prefer a more stock Android interface. But all my apps work well, apps are fast and fluid, call and network quality are better than my OnePlus, and the little extras you get with EMUI makes the phone more productive. Camera functions are extensive and fun to experiment.

And Huawei has by far the best packaging and freebies in the phone game. Includes a nice set of powered ear buds, pre-installed screen protector, clear case, super charger and beautiful box.

I'm on T-Mobile and simply loading my SIM into the new phone made everything work.  All of my apps and settings transferred as expected.

The fast charge feature is immediately valuable and the near-zero bezel is very attractive.  The fingerprint sensor is a quick way to unlock the phone.  Seems lightning fast opening apps and displaying web pages.  Build quality is excellent.

 I like that Huawei is giving Samsung some competition to spur them on a bit more.  I've read up on the security concerns with Huawei and the phones are not an issue.

Too pretty to hide.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2018","I love this phone. I was saddened to learn the Honor 10 phantom colors would not be available in the United States.  I considered the aluminum body of the Honor view 10--it wasn't waterproofed and had a different asthetic.  The mocha brown mate 10 pro is lovely and as close as I can get to the p20pro or honor 10 in the United States.  The mocha is complex metallic bronze. This was an excellent prime day deal.

EMUI is quirky and has a few bloatware items installed (booking.com anyone). But I realize I've become used to them after the Honor 8 and really felt lost when I used a LG q thin.

This phone is lovely and I have no intention of returning it. It's light weight and comfortable in my glove size 8 hand.  The photos are stunning and the leica cameras are worth the hype.

Items that need improvement:
The phone defeats most auto call features from apps such as banks as you have to confirm the call. This means I can't skip the line because it registers as a regular unautheticated phone call.

I miss my dual SIM and/or sd card tray--not enough to return the phone but enough to mention it for future development.

Huawei, consider wireless calling for tmobile.  That's missing and when you need it you need it.

I'm just happy to have some new styles and ideas hitting the us mobile phone market that can withstand inclement weather during commutes.",5,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Huawei-Unlocked-Processor-Camera-Resistant/product-reviews/B078T2T2FL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_42?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=42&reviewerType=all_reviews

Good quality,"Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2019","This is, honestly, the best phone I've ever used. I bought it for the camera as I like to take pictures everywhere I go and it's not always practical to lug a DSLR around. What interested me initially was the Leica dual lens camera with F/1.6 aperture and 20/12 megapixel resolution. It has all kinds of ""smart"" modes but what I found most useful was the pro mode that allows for exposure, film speed and other adjustments as well as offering an actual manual focus in addition to the auto. The camera is amazing and probably overkill for most people, I still find l little things I can do with it every time I snap a new photo. On paper, the Mate10pro has everything I could ever ask for in a phone and more than some high end tablets and computers (Including the one I owned at the time). 6gb RAM and 128gb memory with a 2160x1080 display are pretty impressive and I find myself using the phone more and more in applications usually better left to a computer such as drawing and photo editing. I go to the mate10 when editing my business page in Facebook far more often than my computer.  That being said, I still hesitated about purchasing it due to the pervasive anti-Chinese tech sentiment and their generalized reputation for poor quality- if the charging port in my Samsung S5 hadn't finally stopped working I might still be debating the purchase right now. I pulled the trigger finally and I can say without reservation that I haven't made a better aquistion in my life. Fit and finish are as good as I've ever seen, and the battery life is phenomenal. Using the supplied charger I can get full charge in an a couple hours and it easily lasts through a normal 12 hour shift at work. Even running multiple apps (Facebook, Adobe Sketch) I can count on 4-6 hours before I have to look for an outlet. I bought it this spring and it's proven itself well worth the purchase price ($612 and change for the phone, Spurion case, next day shipping and tax). I've bought a few value minded tech purchases from Chinese companies before and have come to expect a certain trade-off between expectation and price point but I'm left wanting nothing in this particular instance. I'm not a hardcore techie and I doubt that I've really pushed this little machine to it's limits but I'm very impressed and extremely happy with the product I received from Amazon. Oh, one thing I didn't like and still bothers me a bit is not being able to change font style.

I bought this phone because it was cheap and my LG G6 broke. What I love: big screen, stereo speaker, battery life. Dislike: Emui, screen seems kind of washed out at the lowest brightness setting, no headphone jack. I haven't really tested out the camera so I can't say anything about it. Coming from my LG G6 the mate 10 pro is definitely a step up. It doesn't have an always on display or knock to wake, which I didn't know I would miss until I didn't have it anymore. The mate 10 pro does have lift to wake but i personally prefer knock to wake. The screen does seem washed out at low brightness and my g6 actually looks more vibrant I'm not sure if this is a defect with my screen but I will contact Huawei to ask. One other thing is that the USB to 3.5mm adapter fits really snugly into the USB port which is both a good thing and bad thing because when I go remove it I feel like I will rip the adapter, that I have to say doesn't feel well made. Overall I am happy with my purchase UPDATE: I received my replacement and the screen is so much better than the one I first received. The colors are nice and vivid not washed out like the first one I received. I also found the always on display setting though it is named something else. The lift to wake feature is a bit finicky sometimes so I hope I can find the settings to turn that off.",4,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Huawei-Unlocked-Processor-Camera-Resistant/product-reviews/B078T2T2FL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_46?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=46&reviewerType=all_reviews

However, I have the following issues with it:

- I can't configure my business e-mail on it at all (Outlook Exchange) using its native e-mail app. I can configure it just fine but only if I use 3rd party providers/apps (Yahoo! and Gmail e-mail addresses work just fine).

- T-Mobile's Visual Voicemail app won't install on this otherwise beautiful device at all. I tried it again and again and again.

- The Uber app doesn't exactly work right: it opens up, I can see that main screen with the map on the background but there's no search bar/field at the top of the screen where to put the street address in.

Does anybody else have these kind of issues?

UPDATE ON 3/21/2018: I'm switching my initial 4-star review to a full 5-star one.

- The T-Mobile Visual Voicemail app now works just fine.
- Business e-mail has been successfully configured via Mate 10 Pro's native e-mail app.
- I see some improvements on the Uber app. It doesn't work flawlessly just yet, but it seems they're working on it.

There are some really good qualities to the phone.
Design - It feels solid in the hands and I do like the glass back
Battery life - Pretty amazing, One of the best out there
Camera - Solid shooter

Not so good:
EMUI - is still a mess, its convoluted. Menus are buried within menus
App compatibility - I have found not all apps play nice with EMUI. Also battery optimization is too aggressive that background tasks will close. There is an issue floating around regarding widgets not updating (Huawei said they are looking at this)
Wifi Calling - I don't know about ATT but Tmobile does not support Wifi calling on the Mate 10 pro. Huge deal breaker

The last thing is the price. For $800 dollars there are much better options
You could get a Pixel 2 that has a better camera and software experience. Also up to three years of security and software updates
You could get a Samsung S8/S8 plus or on swappa a Note 8
You could save a bit and get a HTC U11 6GB model for $750
You could also save around $300 and get a Oneplus 5T that has a way better software experieince",3,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Huawei-Unlocked-Processor-Camera-Resistant/product-reviews/B078T2T2FL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_58?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=58&reviewerType=all_reviews

I wanted a GREAT phone but one that maybe everyone and their Grandmother may not own too. In any case though more import to me though is owning a great phone that is stable, and great for business..which is what I mostly use it for. This Mate10 Pro is awesome, to use an old hippie word! For one thing and oddly almost no pro or youtube type review ever mentions this..is the call qualify! It's OUTSTANDING clear as a bell with a stronger signal than my S8 Plus. As to Bluetooth it connects in milli seconds to several of my bluetooth headsets and unlike my Samsung phones, nobody has ever complained that they can't hear or understand me or I'm breaking up ala my S8 PLus. esp with various bluetooth devices. The screen on the Mate 10 Pro looks just great even outside on a bright day. I suppose many here will not agree I actually LIKE EMUI very much. Yes for sure there are menus in menus and it's actually amazing JUST how much you can do with this phone. I find when I need a feature I simply google how..or youtube it, and I've yet to get stuck wondering HOW do you set this or that. One reason I left iphone a while ago is I felt it was SO limited as to customization. Well EMUI is amazing..in what it can do...in this case I don't think LESS IS more, ala stock android. Anyway just my opinion. As everyone has said the battery life is GREAT / off the charts...you will need smash the phone with a hammer to kill the battery lol. My only gripe oddly enough is I THINK I may have a semi SLIGHTLY defective camera. Everybody raves about the cameras here even DX0 mark. On almost all my photos the left side tends to be a tad blurry. I have to think this is just MY phone, and I may or may not think about an exchange. Oddly monochrome is tack sharp in every corner.  I happened to pre-order this phone so at $650 it's a steal. That said I think it can go head to head with any Samsung, or LG or plasticky Pixel, so to me the $799 price or so is fair..though I won't complain I paid $650 for it.

However, I quickly realized they modified things on the 10 in order to make it more proprietary. Otherwise, there isn't much difference. The phone is quick but there is no longer an aux port for headphones. Headphones must use the USB-C port and be compatible. I started having trouble with the camera quality as well. The rear-facing camera takes very beautiful quality pictures. However, the front-facing camera was warped and make pictures look distorted. Almost like you're looking through a fishbowl. There were minimally different features such as the ""Translate"" app and the ""full-screen mode"" for apps.

I switched back to the Huawei Mate 9 because i found the 10 to be of lower quality overall. If you have a 9, I recommend staying with it or upgrading to a Samsung Galaxy S9.",1,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Huawei-Unlocked-Processor-Camera-Resistant/product-reviews/B078T2T2FL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews

I just got this phone (US version w/ $150 gc) 4 hours ago. I've spent the past 3.5 hours with at&t agents trying to get the mobile data to work. The technicians tried numerous ways. The phone got reboot multiple times. After hours of battling it still wouldn't work. When I almost wanted to give up, the data network suddenly started to be working, but only on the 3g network. (One more thing, through out the whole process, there was a switch of ""Enable 4G"" in the mobile network setting. It simply cannot be turned on.) The AT&T agent explained that there is no guarantee the non-AT&T-branded phone would necessarily be able to run on the fastest LTE network, even though the device hardware is compatible. I just don't buy that theory, unless HUAWEI is intentionally selling this phone in the US market with the anticipation that it could only work on the 3g network. I don't believe HUAWEI would do such self-harming thing. Overall the phone is fast and amazing. The one star is mostly for its network connection, which I hope AT&T/HUAWEI could help me resolve eventually.
============================
day1, update: I reached out to HUAWEI support after I was done with AT&T customer service. The HUAWEI representative was patient and suggested me to get a new SIM card to test. I will update my review once I have more information down the road.
============================
day 2, update: went to the AT&T store after work. The staff (Johnson who by the way was nice and patient with me the whole time) inserted his SIM card into my mate 10 pro. Then the 4G LTE worked immediately. It made me to believe that all I need to do was to get a new SIM. However after he put in the new SIM card, the phone still runs on 3G. We then pulled it out and put it in his phone, which got no data at all. (there was some awkward silence). Then he noticed my data plan was the old Share w/ rollover plan. He explained to me it was my plan (thus the SIM) that's causing all this issue. Some phones (like his Moto or mine) will not work with the old plan. Yet iphone, BB or Samsung phones are able to because these phones got something special to boost up their signal. He then tried to convince me that changing my data plan to the latest one would ultimately resolve this issue. I refused and went home with a new SIM card in my phone yet the same issue as 1.5 hours ago. As frustrated and helpless, I decided to do one last testing then I would call it a day. I swapped my SIM card with my wife's iPhone7's (we share the same family plan). I first put her SIM in mine, my phone got 4G LTE!! then my SIM card in hers, her iPhone got 4G LTE too!! I couldn't believed my eyes. I swapped them back, carefully, worrying that I might lose this too-good-to-be-true. Surprisingly my mate 10 pro is running on 4G LTE now. I cannot explain it. Maybe it's the influence of the new SIM kicked in with some time lag. But anyhow it worked. I have since then checked a dozen more times the LTE is still on. Now I changed my rating to 5 stars which this phone deserves.",5,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Huawei-Unlocked-Processor-Camera-Resistant/product-reviews/B078T2T2FL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_35?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=35&reviewerType=all_reviews

I received this phone about 2 weeks ago and wanted to wait to review it after my trip to San Francisco. It did not disappoint at all, the camera is fantastic. It consistently outperformed my wife's iPhone 8 plus in every situation, low light, high contrast and zoom. What most impressed me was the battery life! I was on my phone from 7am to about 8pm and the phone still did not die from the heavy usage. The 4000mh battery is now gimmick. I was constantly taking pictures and videos of my kids, researching eating spots, snapchatting all day and posting to Facebook and Instagram. I was thuroughly impressed! There are only a couple concerns I can think of with this phone, not having wireless charging, now I don't use it nearly as much as my wife does but it was available with the previous model so I don't see why it wouldn't be available with the mate 10 pro. And for some reason I initially had a slow WiFi connection. After a system update and a reboot it seemed to go away but comes back every now and then and I have to turn off the WiFi and then turn it back on. But my T-mobile service was constantly outperforming the WiFi which should not be the case. I think with a patch and update this problem should be non existent in the future, internet still works well and this should not deter you from purchasing this phone for nearly half the price of a Galaxy s9 or s9+.",4,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Huawei-Unlocked-Processor-Camera-Resistant/product-reviews/B078T2T2FL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_42?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=42&reviewerType=all_reviews

It has glitches.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2018","I have been waiting for this phone since its announcement months ago. I'm coming from a Mate 9, Mate 7 before that, and a Mate 2 before that, so I expected to love this phone. I'm not loving it. Don't get me wrong, it's a beautiful phone and the edge to edge screen is a huge improvement, but for the money I was expecting something better. It's thin, and I love that, and it's faster than the Mate 9, but not as fast as I expected. The 6GB RAM is more than enough, but didn't make a huge appreciable difference except when I was viewing graphic intensive or had multiple apps going.  It could be the software, and I'm allowing for that before I decide if I'm keeping it. But the software is a tad glitchy and it froze during some web browsing and lagged a few times in some of my apps.  I did NOT expect that from this phone. My apps transferred over within 20 minutes, as did all the usual contacts, pics etc, but nowadays that is the norm and I think most Android users have come to expect a seamless transition to a new device. The sound is good and calls are arguably GREAT with noise cancelling mics. It's still the EMUI, which I don't mind because you can use whatever launcher is your preference...but the setting menus just aren't as improved as I'd hoped for. I think, at this point, the UI should feel more intuitive and polished than it does. The menus are clunky, and a bit confusing. The back is glass...which feels nice but makes me very nervous that I will break it even with a case..or scratch it...Why they cover a phone back in glass is beyond me. The screen is good, but I think it could be more Vibrant. I messed with the display settings and found something better for my personal taste, but still, the screen could look better. It has 128 GB of space...that's plenty for me, so not being expandable isn't a huge deal. I was hoping for wireless charging, and was a little disappointed, though I knew ahead of time so again, not a deal breaker. It's USB Type C...which I prefer.  The finger print scanner is super fast and I like the placement square on the back, and not on the front like some. The camera is great and I love the monochrome mode! My cricket Sim worked fine and I haven't had any issues sending or receiving mms.
This is a great phone....but it's not as great as I think it could be if Huawei tweaked the software...and it's not as great as I expected for the money from Huawei. That probably sounds cheap, but Huawei knows how to make a great phone cheaper than anyone else. It could just be the software, so I'm willing to give it some time, but this phone left me wondering if maybe I should have bought a one plus 5T, with 8Gb RAM for $300 less? Time will tell. I will update my review in week or sooner if there's something to mention.
UPDATE- Day 3 and it's still freezing randomly. I have to reboot to get out of certain apps... Not sure what the conflict is, I haven't been able to pinpoint it yet. Deleted Snapchat and Blink... But still freezing during certain apps. These are the same apps I had on my Mate 9 with no issues and less RAM, so I think it's a software conflict.
Update there are still some glitches I don't like. For example when scrolling on a web page regardless of the browser I'm using, it freezes and I have to wait several seconds for it to catch up. Annoying when reading. Also, the screen sometimes spins, and keeps spinning, even though the phone is perfectly stationary. Sometimes when you click on a link nothing happens and you have to close all programs and try again..regardless of the browser or app, and sometimes all I get is a black screen when I wake it up...no pin screen, no fingerprint screen...just blank black screen...again, have to shut everything down. I kept it because I figured Huawei would fix these issues in relatively short order, but still have enough time to return.",4,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Huawei-Unlocked-Processor-Camera-Resistant/product-reviews/B078T2T2FL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_34?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=34&reviewerType=all_reviews

So far I am very pleased with the phone. It opens instantly from fingerprint, and runs speedily during use. I'm not a big camera person so I will defer to others on that, but the pictures I have taken have been great from my perspective.

The phone comes with a case, screen protector, headphone jack dongle, and headphones which seem to work pretty well. I don't miss a headphone jack - on my last phone the headphones kept slipping out of the jack and my podcast would stop, but on this phone the connection feels much more secure.

I don't wish the phone had wireless charging - this phone charges crazy fast, and I don't see myself replacing 20 minutes plugged in with hours and hours on a charging spot. Battery life is pretty amazing so far.

EMUI doesn't really impress or bother me. It might be nice at some point to be able to run a monitor/TV for videos etc. Otherwise I would be happy with stock android and only modifications to use the NPU.

The only reason why many products are now made in China is due to the USA using their cheap manufacturing labor for decades, and not because China's quality in products. In fact, everything made in China is and has always being of substandard quality, despite China's efforts to say otherwise.

Then, China started to illegally steal USA technology and sell it as if it was their own. However, now that China is trying to ""rise"" and compete with the USA, the USA under Trump has finally said ""Nope, not anymore; America first"".

Accordingly, slowly but surely, China's economy will suffer dramatically in the coming years by the world's largest economy consumers (USA) realizing that Chinese made products are a real security concern for the USA, and not in the USA best interest.",1,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Huawei-Unlocked-Processor-Camera-Resistant/product-reviews/B078T2T2FL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_41?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=41&reviewerType=all_reviews

The build quality of this phone is top notch, so much better than my last phone, Nexus 6. The camera is the best I ever had too. Image quality is great. Needless to say the 20MB monochrome lens generates unbeatable B/W photo. I watched quite a few YouTube review. Mostly they complain about wireless charge and the software interface. First, I don't care about wireless charging. I used to use on my Nexus 6 phone once in awhile, but it's slow and very hot. I was always afraid it will melt my screen off one day. Secondly, the interface is great IMHO. The US version mightve been upgraded from the time other youtubers reviewed the phone. It's very close to the default google Android interface. Nothing like iOS. Many apps are grouped together. App drawer is there out of box. You can add widgets onto the screen like any other Android phone. I always have a calendar widget on a whole screen, which is a must. IOS can never do that. The private space is fantastic if you want have a separate interface for your kids or friends.

One of the best, if not the best phone now. (Yes even with s9out.)","Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2018","This is a great phone. All those mumbo jumbo about spying....I'm pretty sure nsa or some other big bro are reading everything anyway.
Now about the phone itself. I rarely experience any lag. I am kind of person that don't really care how a phone look, as long as it has most of the function i needed or wanted, but this phone is so beautiful i actually got a clear case for it.
The pictures are amazing i actually can brag about how pretty my pictures are to my friend and family that are using iPhone or Samsung. I can set different apertures, take super fast portrait mode.... One surprising feature, the monochrome lens. Wow I never thought I would like anything in black and white. I hated those black and white movies, but The pictures monochrome lens took was wow, I loved it. I felt like I am one of the super famous photographers that have gallery to show off my work. The AI can recognize different things that are on in front of the camera. Once I took a picture of my street it showed that it's scenery then when I took a picture of the same place during snow. It actually has a small snow flake on the bottom of the screen. When I take a picture of my dog it showed a little doggy on the bittom. The AI can determine what are The best setting, lighting, and other parameters to get The best reault.
The battery life is unbelievably long after a while day of work i still have around 70% battery left. Funniest part is started the day with around 94%. It takes  about 2hours to fully charge from 30%. Since I had the phone it never went below 30%.
I don't game allot, but all The game i have it ran quick and smooth. The resolution of the screen is more than enough for  phone this size. All the phones with 4k resolution etc...are way over kill all it does is drain your battery.even at 2k that this phone has is still over kill. Overall The screen is pretty and vibramt. You can also set the screen time to give etc...
The emui is not the greatest os skin but with any new toy it can take a bit of learning curve. There are some thing I missed from my nexus6. I love the large favorite tiles from the Google phone app.but mostly just minor things, over time I will get adopt to it and who knows might even like the way huawei has it.
Now the bad... IT DOESN'T HAS ANY HEADPHONE JACK..... I usually have 2sets of headphone when I am at work, a Bluetooth and a 3.5mm. It's so annoying when my Bluetooth headphone ran out of battery now because my good headphone is not compatible. I have to use the crappy ones that came with it.

S8s9+ they are just too dang tall. I tried it just felt kinda awkward. They are basically the same damn phone, s9 has a better camera. Samsung need the step up. Sorry to bash on samsung, I had their first generation note. i used it for a few years never really like it, too Kathy and buggy. They overpriced their phone just like Apple does. I got this phone for only 650.",5,,

EDIT 02/19:  Got Android 9!","Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2018","Edit as of February 20, 2019:
My Mate 10 Pro, C567 (US version) just received the update to EMUI 9 (Android 9 Pie).
With this update I received better AI, improved camera (better bokeh, better auto brightness/contrast settings), Super SlowMo (960 fps), Face Unlock and dozens of other tweaks and improvements.
Bluetooth issues seem to be fixed as well.
Only HiVision (AI objects recognition) and GPU Turbo seem to be missing, but these were not my top priorities list for this phone and I can pretty much live without them. And while now my Mate 10 PRO looks and feels almost as a new phone, EMUI 9 still requires polishing in terms of fluency.

Overall, after almost a year of using the phone, I'm still pretty happy about it. Selfie camera could be better, and AI postprocessing could be less  aggressive. I can definitely recommend it to those who are looking for a solid phone and don't want to invest a lot into buying current flagship phones.

My only concern remains lack of communication from Huawei regarding updates. They actually delivered monthly updates over the year 2018, and now we have received the long promised Pie update. Still they could communicate about the update plan sooo much better than they actually did.

************************************

Oct.16, 2018 - UPDATE: the phone has recently received a handheld night camera mode with an August security patch, and the update with September security patch has just started rolling out. However, still no sign of Face Unlock or GPU Turbo. Probably, we're entirely skipping Android 8.1 and heading directly towards Android 9.0.

Besides, I've found a pretty frustrating issue: bluetooth audio quality is rather bad - tried it with multiple bluetooth speakers on two phones. The audio codecs in Android 8 are most likely crippled, and looks like lots of Huawei phones have this issue.
We'll see if Android 9.0 can fix this issue.

************************************
Original review below:

Before buying Huawei Mate 10 Pro, I read lots of reviews and discussions on forums - it took a while to make a decision and I don't regret it.

The phone feels very good in a hand. When you take it, you immediately know it's a business-class phone. Screen, battery life and performance are no doubt top class. Camera is really good, but takes some time to master - some scenes get too much overprocessing with AI. It's not a point and shoot camera, but you can get amazing results with it, especially if you learn the Pro Shooting Mode.

I'd totally recommend buying a full screen antiexplosion glass and a good protective case for it, since dropping  the phone may result in large damage to screen/back and a very costly repair.

The only thing that troubles me a lot (and lots of users on xda, reddit etc.) is lack of insights regarding the software updates. Right now, in July, the US version of the phone is still running April security patch (8.0.0.112) and doesn't have the much awaited FaceUnlock or handheld night camera mode yet - while both features have long been launched across Asia and Europe. No comments or announcements have been done in this regard by Huawei.

What's even worse, is that Huawei keeps a full radio silence regarding the further updates - I'm referring exclusively to the US version of the phone now. Recently. they announced transition to a bi-monthly update plan and an upcoming Android 8.1 update featuring GPU Turbo Mode, coming everywhere - but for USA (according to the official sources). It seems like the US version has been abandoned in terms of software updates.

Thus I put 4 out of 5 to this phone, unless there is some clear response from HuaweiDeviceUSAService in regards to the software update plans. Will the US version of Mate 10 Pro get the  FaceUnlock, handheld night camera mode? Will there be updates to Android 8.1 and to Android P? That we are yet to see in the future.",4,,

I was in the Market for the Mate 9 about a year ago when I found out that this one will be out soon. The wait is over and I'm not disappointed.
Data transfer from my old Samsung Galaxy S6 took a mere 12 minutes, and I had a good 20 GB of Data to transfer.
Simply download and install ""Phone clone"" from the App store, load it on both Phones, and you are good to go. (follow the instructions)
 The performance is stunning, very smooth running, I had all my custom sounds and apps running in no Time. The Camera is simply amazing. It does come with a clear Case, which I did not care for too much, so I purchased one from Tudia, it is much more robust and protective.
After 30 or so minutes, I had all my important apps working, set up multiple Email accounts, etc.
A little gripe, but not too big of a deal is that it requires the USB C style Cables. Also, it doesn't support wireless charging.
A bigger Deal is that it doesn't come with Alexa. The Mate 9 did. Oh, well I'll live.
Everyone is raving about the Battery life on this thing, and I have several power hungry apps running at the same time, so we will see about that and I'll report it here.
I haven't used the translator yet, but it looks fantastic. The Camera is truly a marvel, shoots pictures on a very high resolution, the Camera actually recognizes what you shoot and therefore picks the right (or sometimes wrong) settings for you.
The Fingerprint sensor is ultra fast, I use it to unlock the phone. I know I have only begun to work with this phone, there are many more very cool options to use and I'll report it here as soon as I uncovered some useful tricks.
So far I'm impressed, to say the least.

1. Update:
Verizon Customers, listen up!

(read carefully)
QUIT asking if this Phone will work with VERIZON.
It will not. EVER!
At least read through some older questions before you post yours.
Thank you.

I did some extensive research before I settled for the best Huawei phone at the time. I am really picky about camera, Pixel 2 XL was my first choice but didn't buy one because of high price tag and so so  battery life.
The Huawei phone has great size in hand: not as wide as Pixel XL, easier to handle with one hand. The screen size is reasonably good. Although it doesn't have the pixel density as Pixel XL, I was not able to tell the difference during day to day use.
Camera: not as good as the Pixel XL in terms of color vibrancy (Huawei Mate 10 pro photos tend to have more contrast than my liking during high contrast situation), but low light photo is probably a little better due to image stabilization. It's max zoom photo is sharper than Pixel. But those are the extreme situation we are talking about. In those situation, Huawei has a Black and White camera that does a decent job capturing the image.
Software: Unlike some polarizing review about Huawei's operating system, I find Huawei's effort is mostly unobtrusive. The Safe App is a nice touch, but you do loose the full size backup of photos and first in line update Google offered to Pixel phones.
Battery life: OMG, this is where this phone shines. When I am using the Pixel (small one) my battery was at 15% around 6pm; when I was using the Pixel XL, my battery was at 15% around 9pm; while using the Mate 10 Pro, my battery was at 50% around 11pm. The phone saved my day a few times when I was traveling in China, snatching 600 photos at History Museum of Shaanxi and Terra Cotta Museum.
Irregularities: Back in my days with Samsung and Google phones, I would encounter about one unexpected shut-down and re-start. My limited experience with Huawei has no such issue (only four months though).
Overall experience: I use the phone to take pictures, check email, listen to music and watch videos. I do a lot of internet surfing and play very little video games (my son do use it to play games). For what I do with the phone, it runs flawlessly.
Now only if it can process the photo like Google Pixel. It is a very nice phone at a very good price.",5,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Huawei-Unlocked-Processor-Camera-Resistant/product-reviews/B078T2T2FL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews

In other countries, the Huawei Mate 10 Pro is receiving regular software updates but in the United States, Huawei is providing no updates.  Mine is still on a security patch that's 5 months old.  I was told by Huawei support that there is an update (from Google, not Huawei) but there is no way for me to get it until it shows up as an OTA which could take months or never happen at all.  Feature updates like Turbo GPU reportedly aren't coming to owners in the US so the laggy scrolling I'm experiencing probably won't get fixed.  Issues with the spotty Bluetooth are unlikely to ever be fixed either.  Huawei stopped providing bootloader unlock codes for this phone in July so I can't flash a custom ROM.  Alternate methods that Huawei owners sometimes employ to get updates like rebranding so the phone appears to be a model from a different region or using the Funky Huawei online tools are blocked but only on the US model.  Despite having excellent hardware, stylish design and premium build quality this phone isn't worth $500 or even $200 without software updates.",1,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Huawei-Unlocked-Processor-Camera-Resistant/product-reviews/B078T2T2FL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_42?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=42&reviewerType=all_reviews

I consider it silly that a cellphone would ever need to charge battery within a day. However, due to Mate 10 Pro's use of LED, it looks like it cannot run the screen continuously on for 8 hours, which loses one star in the review. But comparing to non-huawei phones, it is still 5 stars plus! Squeezing a big battery in the smartphone actually involves technology advance, for which I think iPhone is at least two years behind in technology, and I don't want to spend hard-earned money in overpriced iPhone either, trying to avoid iPhone's eco-system because everything related will be sucking money. Looks like the most useful google service is google's map, so if Huawei wants to continue to sell its phone without Google' service, Huawei needs to develop an app in similar quality to that of google's map (forget about Microsoft's stupid map). Huawei can do it with its resource, probably building it on top of freestreetmap. That said, truly hope that Huawei can make effort to comply with US policy for its phone to continue to be available, just because no competitors have phones as good as huawei's so far.",4,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Huawei-Unlocked-Processor-Camera-Resistant/product-reviews/B078T2T2FL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_57?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=57&reviewerType=all_reviews

Edit: 11-2019: Best phone ever.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2018","This phone has been great so far. I honestly can't think of one thing about it so far that I don't like. I'm not saying it's perfect for everyone, as it doesn't have every feature that a Samsung Note or Galaxy has, but it's blazing fast, the battery life is as amazing as the reviews say it is, and the camera is very good. The build quality, design, and software features all give it a high end vibe, and the lower screen resolution compared to the Samsungs really doesn't matter. This screen looks amazing, and the trade-off in battery life is worth it, in my opinion. Lastly, I personally am finding EMUI to be a fine iteration of Android on this device. I came from a near stock version and I actually prefer this, and I think this UI plays a big role, along with the AI, in making the battery life something special.

I'm a big fan of Windows Phone, and I'm sad that it didn't catch on, as my two Nokia Lumia phones operated absolutely flawlessly, in a way that Android never has for me, but this phone feels like it has a chance to be the one that I've been looking for.

Anyway, I know I've been gushing a bit, but this phone really is that nice.

November 2019 update: Still using this phone, and it's still flawless. Best phone that I ever owned. Battery life continues to be outstanding, and this is the first time ever that an Android phone has not developed ""quirky behavior"" for me over time.

Also, the charger (usb-c) is completely missing from the package, the USB adapter is sealed but dirt and it says LG electronics on it?  I wonder if this was a returned item from someone else though the phone looks completely brand new, untouched, and free of any finger prints.

After reading more reviews and the software update issues mentioned by multiple people, I am not going to place another order.  Who knows if Huawei would give up the US market amid the tension with US.

You put a cover on it for protection. Check this out, If you buy Diamond black it is $797.61 or midnight blue is$ 689.89 then the mocha brown is $389.00 and grey is $6.92.99  What is wrong with people paying double or triple for a color. I did some research and the black is a porsche design. but the others are all exactly the same. Ok another issue I had was I got the first phone from Maxproductsales next day 2nd day shipping. and had to send it back it was super hot when you plugged it in and you could not hear me when I talked on it, and the phone would cut in and out. So I sent it back and got the huawie p 30 lite  from Purple Passion and as soon as I opened the box and picked up the phone I put it right back in and it went back to UPS  in 13 minutes It was plastic and I did not like it at all so I reordered the HUAWEI mate 10 PRO and Made sure I got it from a different seller THE Tech GROUP  It came with a charge and I went right to you tube and watched all the tricks and things the phone could do and I am still learning. BUT WARNING, my first phone was the Huawei mate se and I loved it so much but it fell onto the black payment and cracked so bad it is now useless. so I brought it to be fixed and it costs 350.00 to fix it and if you go to ebay or here amazon it is brand new for under 160.00. but let me tell you it is absolutely worth every penny. the only reason I did not get the same one is because I thought I was going to have this one fixed and have a spare phone and also I never ever get anything for myself I always do for someone else and this time I said it is time for me to get something nice. But it did take me two weeks to hit the pay button I can get things for others but when it comes to me I have a hard time spending the money. but this money was well spent and I would get it again.

Here's some of the quirks I've dealt with:
Camera
- Each time you open the camera app, you will be spammed with the message: ""Wide aperture adds bokeh effects to your photos to emphasize the subject.""  The message takes up a quarter of the screen and you need to either tap the screen or take a dummy picture before taking your real picture for the message to go away (until you open the camera app again.)
- One day you'll be spammed with the message ""sharpening photo, do not move your phone"" (after every single picture), next day the messages go away completely.

Miscellaneous
- You will not get 3rd party notifications on the always on display, my last 3 phones (even budget ones) supported this feature
- I decided to turn off always on display since lock screen notifications worked, that is until they didn't. Gmail notifications stopped appearing on my lock screen even though everything was enabled, then 3 days later it started working again.
- The battery management is so aggressive on this phone that I think it affected my SMS notifications.  One day a friend sent me an important SMS message which I never received a notification for, he eventually messaged me over google hangouts which I received.  I then opened up SMS and then suddenly the notification finally popped up.  I went to Settings -> Battery -> Launch and realized SMS was set to ""manage automatically"" (default for all apps) while hangouts was set to ""manage manually"" which is why I think alerts work fine hangouts but sometimes not for SMS.
- Huawei doesn't support the popular quick charge standard, so 3rd party QC wall chargers or QC power banks will not fast charge this phone, you'll need to buy official huawei fast charger.

I ended up factory resetting the phone but the issues resurfaced shortly thereafter.

Figured I got a lemon so Amazon sent me a replacement, same exact issues on the 2nd one.

These issues may have been resolved in a software update but Huawei is not supporting the US model with updates.  For perspective, my phone is on April security update and very old firmware .112 (international versions are on .150), so we're missing out on features like face unlock and possible fixes to my complaints above.

I will be returning this phone to Amazon.",1,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Huawei-Unlocked-Processor-Camera-Resistant/product-reviews/B078T2T2FL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews

The monochrome secondary camera is awesome (black and white) and way better than using a black and white filter. It is an actual feature that separates this phone from the pack.

The IR blaster is useful. I lost my ac remote and this phone turned it on and it only took me like 5 seconds to figure it out. Same with my grandma's tv, cable box and bedroom smart TV (testing). Went to a donut shop and they had CNN on and I turned off the fake news so I can enjoy my donuts with my daughter.

The 4000 mAh battery is awesome. You get two solid days of moderate use. You can turn power saver on and get more milage... I don't recommend ultra power saver but it is a thing... Turns off GPS, autorotate etc.. not sure how much life I would get...

I don't seem to get as much NSA, FBI, spying it seems... I had an iPhone before and if I talked about Machu Picchu I would get flight advertising to Peru or if I talked about cruiseships, Bam ad for cruise on my Facebook... This doesn't seem to happen so I guess the Chinese government has nothing to offer me. I can turn the GPS off so that is neat... But Trump is going to decriminalize marijuana so if I ever need medical weed it will probably be legal by then... And I will probably have abother phone.

Anyway this phone is awesome. Price came down and for a 2017 flagship it is holding up well to 2018 phones.

No jack, no wireless charging. Comes with headphones that plug into the port without adapter and I can't tell the difference between jack and no jack.

Wireless charging does eat up the electric bill anyway so I am okay with out it. Phone charges fast and it is not like I need to hit 100% with this thing, 70% is like 100% compared to other phones so that is a thing.",5,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Huawei-Unlocked-Processor-Camera-Resistant/product-reviews/B078T2T2FL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_49?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=49&reviewerType=all_reviews

And recently purchased Huawei Mate 10 Pro US edition. I have to admit that this phone is much better than Huawei Mate 9, the camera is way better although Mate 9 also uses Leica lenses. I would say this Mate 10 pro take pictures as good as a mirrorless nikon or sony that sells for $600 or more. The aperture is as good as the prime lens 1.8f can deliver on my Nikon SLR. The other amazing thing of Huawei Mate brand is the battery life. The Samsung S7 edge I owned has 3700 mA battery and the Huawei Mate series uses 4000 mA battery. You would assume that battery life is about the same since 3700mA is almost on par with 4000mA. That is totally wrong. Huawei Mate Series 2/9/10 delivers 2 day plus battery life with 4000mA but Samsung deliver 1 day with 3700mA. It must have to do the battery management optimization done by Huawei. The final thing I would comment is that Huawei have much better signal strength than Samsung. I work on 6th floor of a building no cellular towers nearby, my Samsung S7 consistently have about 1 bar at work and 4 bars at home. But my Huawei Mate 10 pro delivers 3 bars at work and 5 bars at home. I think this is really a great phone if you want to go contract free and knows about what you want. It is sad that Huawei decided to release Mate 20 only in Europe and Asia. This might be the only Mate phone you can buy with US warranty for a short while. The alternative, $1000 phones from Samsung or Apple? I only paid $499 for this Huawei, why should I pay more.",5,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Huawei-Unlocked-Processor-Camera-Resistant/product-reviews/B078T2T2FL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_43?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=43&reviewerType=all_reviews

Great alternate to Samsung & Apple offerings.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2018","Quite happy with this phone!  So nice to have a top end phone here in the US that doesn't fit what the masses have with the Samsung or Apple options.  Using this phone on AT&T and works wonderful with 4gLTE.  The camera is outstanding and is easy to take beautiful photos with.  The phone has been extremely fast running games, movies, general apps etc.  No crashes, slow down, etc.  Have had zero issues with call quality- has sounded clear on both ends of the call.  For the size, the phone feels pretty light as well.  Coming from a smaller Xperia Z3 I was a little worried how the slightly larger phone would feel- no regrets!  The screen is beautiful as well.  Some reviews on other sites noted it has a slightly lower resolution than some alternate options- frankly unless you are running image tests, you wont notice in day to day use.  It's a beautiful screen.  Sound quality is a step up from my old Xperia as well.  Overall, very thrilled with this offering from Huawei.  I also have the Huawei Classic Watch 2 paired with this- perfect combo and is working great.  Do your research about the tech on this phone, it's top notch.  The US is getting this one a little later than the international community but it's good to know it has been a hit in many countries outside of the US.  Really solid option for US consumers if you are looking for an alternate to the big 2 here.

A note on car chargers and extra wall chargers- if you want to keep the extremely fast charging this phone is capable of, be sure to look for 5A charging capable cables and devices.  Many of the other devices use 2A or 3A charging which doesn't provide the power this device needs for its quick charge abilities.  Couple examples from items I ordered that are working well: Dual USB Car Charger Super Charge 5A USB Type C Charging Cable and USB Type C Nylon Braided Super Fast Charging Cord(5A) Standard usb c cables and chargers should work but wont get you the super charge capabilities.",5,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Huawei-Unlocked-Processor-Camera-Resistant/product-reviews/B078T2T2FL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews

Loved them. Then they screwed up the note 8 or was it 6? Then skipped 7?  Regardless they threw me a curve ball, or should I say a curved a screen. Out of all my years I never broke or cracked a single phone or screen. Edge 7 broke them both in a short period of time. I am a super geek and research the hell out of electronics, especially my phone. When I found Huawei (can never remember how to spell it) I was skeptical. Bought the gray a mate SE first lol and was blown away with quality. Bought this phone a few days later and I am in heaven.  Everything is better than expected and not roped into my TMobile contract waiting for the phone to be paid off.  Thank you Huawei for exceptional quality and craftsmanship. You are the new bad ass.

Update: Been over a month now. I am so in love, it is crazy. Phone takes absolutely stunning photos. Zoom is crazy good. Battery still last like crazy, I literally use the heck out of my phone and at 2 am still has 60% battery. Calls, music, videos, games all day long. I use it to check my website and love the fact I never have to worry about a charger being close. Super fast and handles all the apps I throw at it. Way more options than Samsung ever thought about. The finger scanner is incredible. Have it set up for both hands so no matter what I can unlock phone quickly. OH camera opens as fast as you can snap your finger.

For whatever reason Facebook's Messenger doesn't appear in the list, but that will hopefully be fixed with an update.

Speaking of updates, I talked with Huawei support and we can expect to NOT receive the GPU Turbo update, though every two months we can probably expect security and other patches.

Almost everything about it is phenomenal. Yeah EMUI is a tad bid dated, but nothing Nova Launcher can't fix. The first week battery life was kinda meh, but after a week it REALLY turned around. On my old Pixel I would usually leave work after a 12 hour shift on about 30% with excellent signal coverage while listening to music and watching videos on break occasionally. With this thing, I do all that and more and leave with 60% battery which is just insane. Although it doesn't have a headphone jack, it kicks it pretty decent sound with a nice pair of USB C headphones. It's quick, responsive, and gorgeous to look at. I'm still learning how to work the camera, so far I've gotten decent shots but it's still not comparing to the 1st Gen Pixel camera, but it's almost there when I figure out how to handle exposure in the pro mode.

I love this phone. It's got everything. The AI is great. Leica camera is one of the best ever. Huawei is probably the best cellphone manufacturer in the world. Their quality and specs beat Apple and Samsung. Too bad the trade war with China doesn't allow Google to associate with Huawei anymore.

Plus the sensor at the back is at such a convenient location that I just need to hold my phone as normal and my finger just touches it with ease.
Surprisingly the phone also arrived with a screen protector already applied (just peel off the top dust protection layer and you are done) as well as a transparent phone case from Huawei itself - no other shopping necessary!

Screen dims on any given website unless you have it set to max brightness. At max brightness that massive 4000 mah battery will deplete quickly. No matter the settings, if you go into any given website, perform any given internet search, that screen will automatically dim. This is a well documented issue online WITH NO FIX TO DATE FROM HUAWEI!!! Technical support is, per usual, abysmal. Highly repetitive support that speaks broken English, and has absolutely no clue as to how to address any given issue, let alone the one I am writing about. I used to have a Huawei Mate 9 that was spectacular. At just 50% screen brightness, the screen was stunning and NEVER DIMMED!!!!!!!! I will never again purchase another Huawei phone. Highly unfortunate. Anyone providing a great review on this phone has undoubtedly settled for whatever experience they are having. I am stunned at how little commentary in reviews there is about this dimming issue. AGAIN, just research it and you will see. And by the way, I have read some people say that this is common on Huawei phones. NO, it is not!!!

UPDATE: I KEEP GETTING EMAILS FROM HUAWEI APOLOGIZING FOR THE ISSUE OF THE SCREEN DIMMING NO MATTER THE SETTING ON WHATEVER SITE I GO TO, BUT I HAVE CALLED THEM MULTIPLE TIMES AND HAVE EVEN SPOKEN TO SUPERVISORS AND THE SERVICE IS ABSOLUTE TRASH!!! THEY WILL NOT, I REPEAT, WILL NOT SEND OUT A REPLACEMENT UNIT, LOANER, NOTHING!!!!!!!!! ONLY SUGGESTION IS TO SEND IN THE PHONE (WHO TODAY HAS A BACK UP PHONE TO REPLACE THEIR PRIMARY CELL PHONE - I DON'T!!!!!), OR TAKE IT BACK TO WHERE I BOUGHT IT FROM!!!!!! THIS COMPANY IS HORRIBLE. MAYBE IT IS TRUE WHAT THE GOVERNMENT SAID ABOUT THE SPYING STUFF HERE IN THE U.S. LET'S FACE IT, THERE IS TECHNICALLY NO RETAIL STORE RIGHT NOW SELLING THESE PHONES. EVERYONE HAS STOPPED SELLING THE PHONE. YOU HAVE TO NOW GET A HUAWEI PHONE ONLINE. AGAIN, MY SUGGESTION IS: DO NOT BUY!!!! DO NOT BUY!!! DO NOT BUY!!!

UPDATE: WAS CALLED YESTERDAY, AFTER ALMOST 2 FULL DAYS SINCE RETURNING IT BACK TO ORIGINAL RETAILER, AND A TECHNICAL SUPPORT REP TOLD ME THAT HE WAS INSTRUCTED TO SEND ME ANOTHER UNIT BUT OF COURSE THEY WOULD NEED THE DEFECTIVE ONE BACK. TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE. THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH INCREDIBLE PROTOCOL CHANNELS BEFORE IT CAN BE DECIDED WHAT TO DO WHEN A CUSTOMER HAS AN ISSUE. ALL THE WHILE YOU ARE WAITING (MOST LIKELY WITHOUT A PHONE, OR A DEFECTIVE ONE AS IN MY CASE). THE GUY TELLS ME HE HAS TO GET BACK IN CONTACT WITH ME AGAIN TO DETERMINE IF HE CAN STILL SEND OUT A REPLACEMENT PHONE SINCE I NOW TOOK BACK THE ONE I HAD. HE NEVER CALLED BACK. I CALLED THIS MORNING 5/12/18. NOW THEY ARE OFFERING A COUPON, A COUPON!!!, FOR WHATEVER I WANT TO USE IT FOR ON THEIR WEBSITE. THIS AFTER THE REP WAS AGAIN SPEAKING BROKEN ENGLISH, AND BEING HIGHLY REPETITIVE REGARDING EVERYTHING!!!!!!! I SAID.

I AM CERTAIN THAT HUAWEI WILL DO GREAT IN OTHER COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY WITH TODAY'S CUSTOMER THAT IS WILLING TO ACCEPT PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING WITH THE HOPE THAT UPDATE, AFTER UPDATE WILL MAKE BETTER THEIR PHONE. PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA THAT HUAWEI STAY OUT OF THE U.S. THIS COMPANY IS NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME.",1,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Huawei-Unlocked-Processor-Camera-Resistant/product-reviews/B078T2T2FL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_59?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=59&reviewerType=all_reviews

I had the Mate SE before, which was great. My girlfriend's Samsung S7 wouldn't hold a charge so I gave it to her, she loves it too. So, I decided to buy myself the Mate 10 pro because of the camera and I was not disappointed. The call quality is perfect and the battery lasts longer than any phone I've had by far. The camera is amazing and has a bunch of cool modes, I won't go crazy into details but I can assure you it's awesome. Get away from Samsung and iPhones. These phones are superior and half the price. I did a ton of research and found the spying thing is just trash started by Samsung and apple to try to keep Huawei out of THE US market.

Offers some nice features such as a (limited) desktop mode that would have served me well. EMUI 8.0 feels a bit closer to Google's version of Android and the few pre-installed apps can be easily uninstalled.

However, there are some downsides which lead me to return mine:

The device doesn't support VoWiFi on the T-Mobile network! If you need that feature because of low signal at home or in your office, look elsewhere! Regarding to a post on XDA, this feature is exclusively to the AT&T network.

Auto focus on the camera seems to work only if it feels like it. I took a number of sample shots and most of them looked sort of blurry.

The implementation of the ""always on"" display is mediocre at best! You will receive notification on the lock screen only for some (Huawei) apps. For anything else, you have to unlock the device and check the notification manually. Also, there is no ""tab to wake"" feature. Having to push the power button or lift up the device to unlock it with the finger print reader is rather annoying. And you will do that quite often when the device lays before you on the desk; somehow you have to check your notification. Not cool, Huawei!

SmartLock is rather useless. There is no option to keep the device unlocked based on your location, with trusted voice or your face. The only option available is via Bluetooth devices around you. Huawei has their own ""voice unlock"" on board but that is essentially for making phone calls or answering a call.

Maybe I am nitpicking here but all this gives the device an ""unfinished"" feeling. Most if not all of it could be fixed via software updates but, unfortunately, for that price, I am just not willing to gamble. I'll miss the good looks and the desktop mode but, as it stands, the device is not for me.",3,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Huawei-Unlocked-Processor-Camera-Resistant/product-reviews/B078T2T2FL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_56?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=56&reviewerType=all_reviews

Wonder woman gal Gadot uses this phone also,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2018","I bought this phone on Amazon may 30 2018 and it is a better phone and had a better camera then the iPhone x and Samsung 9. I read the reviews on imaging resources and snark concerning the p10 pro  before I purchased this phone on Amazon. J was originally going to buy a Sony a7iii camera but thought my not have a great camera and a great smartphone for 650 instead of spending 2899 on the Sony camera with a lens

I already own the iPhone x and the huwaei honor7x

After 2 days with this huwaei mate 10pro I can say get this phone.
Everything works great and I think this camera and battery life puts apple to shame.
After apple slowed down my iphone6plus I was very angry.
If huwaei was available in Verizon it would outsell apple easily and Samsung
I like the battery lasts for 2 days and this phone is water-resistant ip67 .
The supercharger charged my phone in 30 minutes

I also love that it has Leica lenses as I now have a Leica camera

The bottom line IMAO get this phone just like Wonder woman gal Gadot uses this phone as her smartphone

THE ABSOLUTE BEST IN COMPUTER, TABLET, AND SMARTPHONE TECHNOLOGY!!!","Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2019","I am taking a chance here and giving the HUAWEI MATE 10 PRO SMARTPHONE an All Perfect Score before I even get the phone!!!  But I will Update this review if when I get the phone and I am Disappointed by it!!!  But I don't think I will be!!

Anyway, back during this past CHRISTMAS I was looking for a very good and solid brand new tablet.  I didn't really want an IPad!!  I've never had an Apple anything...  So I was looking for an Android tablet whose quality was equal to or Even better than the IPad Pro!!!

And then I saw the Huawei M5 Media Pad 10. 8"" Pro!!!  After reading its awesome specs I knew that was the One for me and after receiving it I knew that I had  made the Right decision!!  I love my new HUAWEI M5 MEDIAPAD 10.8"" PRO!!!  And so when I read the specs about the HUAWEI MATE 10 PRO SMARTPHONE.....I knew Immediately that I wanted that phone!!!  And my wife even decided to buy it for me for my wedding anniversary present!!!

And I am r really excited about it too!!!  I read all the specs about the phone and that baby is like having a high powered 6 inch gaming computer!!!  With its 128GB drive and its 6GB RAM along with all the other awesome specs about the phone.... I just know that I'm going to have THE BEST PHONE EVER!!!

And I think my BRAND NEW HUAWEI MATE 10 PRO SMARTPHONE is even better than the new Samsung S10!!!

The phone has a large screen, is fast, looks good, doesn't mysteriously reboot randomly (like  the one I won't name), no compatibility issues (which surprised me considering it's running EMUI) and has 128gb onboard storage (which is plenty for me). The fingerprint sensor on the back works extremely well and allows you the ability to unlock the phone via this avenue (so no more needing to press the power button to turn on the screen before scanning your fingerprint). The phone comes with a case and screen protector, so it's instantly usable as a normal device out of the box . The only downside I've found, is also tied to one of this phone's positive, in that the screen protector which comes pre-installed on the screen of the phone isn't that great. It'll give you some limited protection, but nothing like a tempered glass protector would. Overall, it's my only complaint and if you consider that this comes with the phone at no extra cost, isn't that much of a drawback.

I know my way around Android and the various skins.

Recently, I purchased an Honor View10 from Amazon. It was supposed to be a slightly watered-down version of this phone and it was dual sim and was priced well. I sent it back within a day because I simply could not get notifications for most of my apps. I'm quite versed at how Huawei does this to save battery, as well as the settings to ""Launch"", ""Battery Optimization"", and ""Priority"" that you need to change if you want to get notifications.

I was hoping it would be different with the premium version of their phone. I shouldn't have been naive. The build quality and hardware are superb. But this thing is useless as a smartphone. If you actually want to get notifications for your apps, look elsewhere.

The reviews are glowing for this phone from many of the bloggers. I can't figure out if they didn't actually use it or if they simply don't need to get notifications. I adjusted every single setting I needed to (again; launch, battery optimization, priority) for all of my apps and when the screen was off, nothing was coming in. Notification light never fired off. I turned on the phone and there was nothing on the lockscreen. I unlocked the phone, opened the email app and manually refreshed and finally got mail (it was set to push). It should not be this way. Ever. And you should not ever have to do this much work to try and get notifications working on a smartphone out of the box anyway.

I returned it. This will be the last Huawei device I ever buy. I liked my Mate 8, but only because I rooted that so I could get notifications working (you have to use Titanium Backup to freeze the app that does all of this to save battery life). Xiaomi has something similar on their phones, but once you disable the battery saving features, you actually get notifications. I had the Mi Mix, Mi Mix 2, and Mi Mix 2s. All worked flawlessly. But without root, I can't get a Huawei phone to work the way it should.

So be warned.",1,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Huawei-Unlocked-Processor-Camera-Resistant/product-reviews/B078T2T2FL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_35?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=35&reviewerType=all_reviews

I always use high end phones and was currently using the Pixel 2 XL before this phone. From an aesthetics standpoint, this phone blows the Pixel away but my problem is EMUI.
Here are the things I love;
1) In my opinion, this is the nicest looking phone on the market and it feels great in the hand. A major plus for this.
2) Call quality is excellent. I think it gets better reception and sound great on both ends.
3) Battery & Fast charging. I won't dive too deep into this but this phone is a beast on battery life. I typically have at least 40% remaining by the time I go to bed where in the past, I would have had to put a phone on the charger. Kudos for this.
4) The speakers sound really good. Not quite as loud as the Pixel, but that is because the lower speaker is on the bottom. Still, it sounds really good.
5) Pretty easy setup with the Huawei smart switch but Android is petty easy anyway. Still, took about a half hour to transfer everything.
6) Fingerprint scanner is the fastest and most accurate I have ever seen. This is important to me since EMUI does not support Smart Lock. More on that in the negatives.

Now the negatives;
1) I'm not a huge fan of EMUI. It is a lot better than it used to be, but I feel like I need a manual to figure it all out. Tons of hidden menus / sub menus
2) Scrolling video works poorly. I am not referring to watching a video or live stream, I am referring to events. I use Nest cameras and could normally scroll through events. On this phone, it just turns black and blurry. I've tried this on two different phones and they are exactly the same. On the Pixel 2, as well as my wife's Iphone, it scrolls perfectly. It has nothing to do with the wifi or signal either as both are great. Just keep this in mind if you are using a Nest camera system.
3) My call blocker is useless with EMUI. I have tried every setting suggested by TrueCaller, and nothing works. All calls come right through. This could be a deal breaker for me as I am overwhelmed with solicitations and spam calls. There is an internal blocker but I need specific types of calls blocked.
4) Alerts are hit or miss. Sometime you get them, and sometimes you don't as evidenced by my Ring Pro doorbell. This is both in the office, and home. I have done  a hard reset, cleared the cache, and also tried reinstalling the app. This is not a deal breaker but I don't understand why it does not work all of the time.
5) EMUI does not use the android smart lock feature. In my opinion, this is one of the best features of android. Basically the system is programmed to know and trust you so it will not lock in the designated areas.
This feature does not exist in EMUI except a bluetooth function that sort of does a similar function, but only works half of the time. If you are like me, and constantly picking up your phone, and putting it down, it is an extra step to have to always unlock it. I have no idea why Huawei would not use the android smart lock function.

Ok, so I am not saying this is not a great phone. It is but it lacks the specific functions I use and need on a daily basis. I am trying to love it, and still not sure if I will keep it or not but if I am unable to get a bit more consistency from it, I think it's going back. I will give it a couple of weeks to see if the AI chip learns or changes anything. Just my opinion for what it's worth.

Edit 3/4/18
I really tried to like this phone, and unfortunately, I really do like it. However, after several attempts with Huawei to get the blockers working, and the issues with my notifications, the phone is going back. I tried everything from factory resets, to any and all possibilities. More than I have ever done to try to get this phone to work as needed.
I could honestly say that this could be my favorite phone I have ever used but the lack of necessary features just kill it for me.

I never upgraded this fast after a phone purchase, but this phone just had so much more that I wanted battery, wired TV connection, more ram, ir blaster etc.  I never really consider astetics when buying a phone but I am often blown away by how pretty this phone is, not only just the outside but even something as simple as the Dialer looks great.

In reading Some of the other reviews I noticed people missing alerts From Certain things,  I noticed this as well but I figured it out.  The phone tries to save battery in doing so it limits background activity, if you have an app you want to see those alerts from  go to settings>battery>Launch  here switch the apps you want alerts  from to Manual and enable everything.  I did this with my text automator app and alarm clock apps to get them working.  Some have enough faulted emui for its complexity but I enjoy being able to have control over every aspect of my phone performance.

Update: charging performance on this phone is beyond anything I've ever had before I've had phones with Quick Charge 3 they do not compare at all.  Even after a 14 hr work day using the phone extensively I only get down to 30% at most...

The build is decidedly premium and the device is chocked full of features. EMUI is definitely an acquired taste but, after using it for some time, I found myself liking it - that being said, it's about as far away from stock android as you can get. The deal breaker for me - and the reason I actually got rid of this device - was the complete and utter lack of any updates for the US variant of this device. The US variant was excluded from the turbo GPU rollout and, at the time I got rid of my device in late August, it was STILL running on the April (yes, that's April) security patch. Unfortunately Huawei has essentially abandoned its US customer base and, given the circumstances, I can't entirely blame them. It's a real shame too because this is truly a spectacular device, but the lack of post-purchase support and updates is really inexcusable for any flagship device. That being said, if software updates and timely security patches are not essential for you, this device is worth considering. Unfortunately, for me, all the great aspects of this device were not enough for me to look past using a flagship device running with nearly 6 month old security patch.",3,,

Gill,I wholeheartedly recommend this phone,"Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2018","It is the best phone I've ever owned and a valid alternative to other flagships by Samsung and Google.  I have no regrets. Buy this phone.

Where it wins out:

Design - This baby is not only beautiful, it just feels right in your hand.  People keep on asking me, ""What is that?"" It screams ""Quality"".
Battery - It is a beast that lasts all day long.
Fast charging -  With the supplied adapter, it charges amazingly fast.
Fingerprint Sensor - Nothing is this fast or accurate.
Price - Just barely now, but I got the 150 gift card during pre-release.

Where it is comparable to the others:

Speed - They all are fast enough.
Camera/Videos -  The Pixel is better, but not by much. I am loving the black and white camera.
Call quality - Excellent.  MUCH better than Samsung.
Speakers - Not as nice as the Pixel, but still much better than most.
Display Quality - It does not have as high a resolution as the others, but it really doesn't matter. It looks better to me than the Pixel 2 XL's screen does. It has an extremely bright and beautiful display.

Where it is quirky:

EMUI 8 -  I am enjoying the interface, it is certainly much better than TouchWiz. Lots of setting options that you will either love or hate.  It takes some time to learn.  It is one of the few Android phones that I haven't felt the need to install Nova Launcher on to correct deficiencies with the launcher it ships with. Many of the setting are genuinely useful and an improvement over standard Oreo.
SmartLock implementation is missing -  Bluetooth unlock seem to work fine, but why doesn't it stay unlocked by location or have face unlock like other Huawei phones? I thought I might miss these, but the fingerprint unlock works so well, I haven't missed it at all.

What it is missing that matters to me:

Accessories -  I bought several cases to try a variety of them.  The one I ended up using is made by Huawei, but I haven't seen it sold here in the US yet.  Search for Huawei Mate 10 Pro Car Kit CF80.  Also, there are too many fake Huawei OEM fast chargers out there. Buy the one sold and shipped by Amazon to get an authentic one.

What is missing that might matter to you:

WiFi calling - It is not supported on T-Mobile. I have great coverage where I am, so it doesn't matter to me.
No SD card - 128GB internal is plenty for me.",5,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Huawei-Unlocked-Processor-Camera-Resistant/product-reviews/B078T2T2FL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_45?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=45&reviewerType=all_reviews

Fain,What's not to love? (Edit 09-30-2018: Android Auto doesn't work!),"Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2018","I recently bought a Mate 10 for personal use. I had previously had the original Samsung note, an S4, a Note 4, a Huawei Honor 7X, Huawei 8, Hoawei Mate 9, and now this. I have never been happy with the reliability of Samsung phones. The Note lost the GPS just past warranty, and the S4 had to be replaced several times for various reasons while under warranty. The Huawei 7X wasn't powerful enough for me, though still a reliable phone. The GPS quit working on the 8 just past warranty. I broke the screen on the 9and had it replaced but they say they can't get factory screens for Huawei phones so they replaced it with an aftermarket screen, which I broke within a few months. They replaced it a couple more time because I could only make them last a couple months at a time. Meaning the non-OEM screens are not gorilla glass or any other break resistant glass. If you buy a Huawei phone be very careful so you don't break the screen.
Having said all that, I love this phone! Consumer Reports rated it at 78 points with the Samsung S9 being rated at the top with 81 points and several other Samsung and Apple phones between that and this Mate 10. The deal breakers are that this phone can be had for $500 on Amazon, while the other phones run between $600-1000, and the battery life on this phone is really pretty amazing (As well as on my previous Mate 9). I am a heavy user and it rarely gets below 60% at the end of the day.
The camera is pretty sweet, better than the Mate 9, which was good in it's own right. The 'Merican Mate 10 only has one sim slot and no extra slot for memory, though it DID come with 128g of ram and 6 gigs for the operating system. There is literally zero lag ever. They make their own CPU which is probably why they can sell this phone cheaper, rather than having to buy them from the same place the other makers do.
See attached photos; One of the lenses is B&W and it's pretty impressive. It's fun to experiment!
As for reliability, I'm more impressed with these phones than the ones made by Samsung, more so since they cost half of a comparable Apple or Samsung phone. My Mate 9 still works like a clock even though I drop it about once a day and have broken several screens. I hope this one does as well.
Edit: 9-30-3028: There is one downside for Huawei phones in general, and the Mate 10 Pro is no exception. It will not work with Android Auto that is in newer cars, including my 2017 Dodge Charger Daytona. This is my fourth Huawei phone and none of them has worked with AA. I emailed them about this and they sent a curt reply that their phones are not compatible. When queried by news organizations they have stated that they are working on a fix. However, they have been saying this since 2016. Meaning, don't buy a Huawei phone if AA is critical to you because they may never fix it. One star removed for that. Otherwise, it's a great phone.",4,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Huawei-Unlocked-Processor-Camera-Resistant/product-reviews/B078T2T2FL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_43?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=43&reviewerType=all_reviews

All I can say is WOW. The construction is solid, the phone feels and looks just solid. The power of Octa-core CPU combined with 6GB of RAM makes it run smooth. But this not what I love the most about it. Here are 3 things that made me love this phone, and make my friends and family seriously consider switching:
- Battery life: I will wake up at 6:30 am, unplug the phone, NOT charge it the entire day, and at 11 pm it will still be at around 20 to 40%! Compare: Samsung S8 - needs to be plugged in by about 1 pm.
- Camera: Leica lenses and real-time post-processing on the device - the pictures are stunning (especially open aperture mode which dynamically blurs the background for emphasis - wow. Even in the video mode!
- No bloatware. This device carries as close to stock Android as you can get on a non-Google device. A few vendor apps of which most could be disabled.

There ARE a few drawbacks, but not important for me:
- no wireless charging: yes, would be nice to have
- no 3mm jack: at some point, it will be a thing of the past
- no micro-SD slot. THAT was the biggest disappointment. I had to retire my 256GB card. The phone has 128GB, which is plenty.

So for me: bye bye Samsung - it has been a good run, hello HUAWEI.

I've been an iPhone user for many years and even got iPhone X last year. However, I suffered some IOS issues when Apple launched the updated IOS. Every 2 weeks, there was an update to fix IOS bugs. It took 2 months for all my IOS issues to be fixed. Don't get me wrong, iPhone X is a great phone, but I'm bored with it. My sister has been using Huawei Mate series for couple of years, and she loved it (she was also an iPhone user before). Therefore, I decided to give it a try. I love how this phone functions. It is fast. Camera is good. I just need to get used to how Android operates. I'm very satisfied with this phone. I do not have connectivity issues with AT&T like couple of other users did. This phone charged very fast. When I received it yesterday, it had around 55% of battery life. I was playing with it for 6 hours to set it up, install apps, rearrange the apps, update my contacts, and transfer pics and music to this new phone.

I wanted something unlocked, and didn't want an iphone or Galaxy, which leaves little options at the regular electronic stores, so I one day ordered through Amazon (which went great) something I thought would match my needs the best. Phone itself is great looking, great size and weight. The fingerprint scanner on the back is one of the most responsive I've ever used, and the optional gestures using that work well too. The general software it comes packaged with are eh. I prefer stock Android, so am running Nova Launcher to avoid EMUI as much as possible or to make it at least feel that way.

There are a lot of weird ticks with this phone, and there aren't a lot of third party apps that you can use that integrate smoothly. The stock dialer is ugly and messy, but nothing else really works I've tried so I tend to mostly make calls via Google Contacts or by searching for a phone number in Chrome etc. The always on screen notifications are pretty spotty at best, and the notification led is not very customizable, and even if it was the brightness of it is so minimal I can barely see it in regular light. This means I tend to not see important texts or missed calls until much later most of the time, which is pretty obnoxious. I never realized I liked having the always on screen as much as I do, but since half the time it doesn't show the text or missed call icon, even just using the stock apps to send/receive them it really limits the usefulness of this feature.

The stock camera software is pretty bad, and the regular color camera just takes ok pics. There are a lot of options that ""camera people"" will enjoy, but having come from the 6P and it's way ahead of everyone camera to this, has been disappointing. If I wanted to tweak settings like I was using a DSLR, I would literally just pull out my DSLR. The B&W camera however is insane, and takes amazing pics, but as I generally only grab pics with my phone for social media stuff or reminder lists, this is a little useless overall and just feels like a gimmick. I've tried a few third party camera apps, but again, the integration is spotty at best, and nothing really seems to make anything better than the not great stock app, so it's a wash.

Updates from Huawei appear to be nearly non-existent for the US model, for what appears to be a myriad of reasons. This isn't the place to get into any of the political reasons or how I feel either way, but the lack of updates or hopes of one is pretty wack. EMUI 9/Pie have been rolling out to different international versions of this phone for almost 2 months now, and I'm not even on 8.1 yet. And in the 2ish months I've had the phone now, I've only received 2 security updates. For a flagship phone less than 2 years old in this day and age, that's pretty unacceptable. Especially coming from the 6P, which was getting updates up until December 2018, this has taken some getting used to.

The battery is definitely the best part of this phone, with some notes. I've tweaked the hell out of every option I can to get the best settings for me, and how I need my phone to function. That means I override the AI as to what can use the phone when, and what apps have access to what options etc. It's dumb I had to spend hours doing this, but it was worth it. That said, I rarely find myself charging this more than once every 48 hours or so. And when I do, it's almost never to 100% (not because of any rules some blog might have written about for battery optimization, just I haven't needed to), and I still usually get 2 full days out of it. Goodbye are the days when I leave the house with the phone only at 30% and have that nagging feeling in the back of my head all morning that I need to find a place to charge it up. That alone makes up for many of my other complaints with this phone, because I've had some amazing phones over the years that could barely pull 8 hours on a full charge with how I used them, but this thing is a beast in that department so put that in the pros column for sure.

Overall, I doubt I would recommend this phone for most people. People wanting an unlocked experience, with the option to customize your rom or any of the other perks that comes with it, forget about it. If you're literally just trying to have a phone you can swap providers with easily, there are better/cheaper options. EMUI is far too invasive and lacks basic options many of us are used to if you've ever used stock Android, iOS, or any flagship Samsung phone, and would be pretty frustrating to use for someone who isn't a phone nerd, but said phone nerd would be pretty turned off by the limits of this phone so why bother? And as there's basically no third party ROM support for this phone due to many issues, the viability of this phone once official support is cut off means this thing is already pretty obsolete.

I definitely regret my purchase, and know I could return the item to Amazon even now because their policy is pretty robust in that regard, but I don't think I'd feel right doing that. So for now I'll ride this thing out, wishing the 6P was my forever phone and had a new huge battery with updates, and plan to replace my Mate 10 Pro by fall of 2020 when I am sure it will be a paperweight by then.",3,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Huawei-Unlocked-Processor-Camera-Resistant/product-reviews/B078T2T2FL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_43?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=43&reviewerType=all_reviews

Judi customer service is useless and they cannot resolve any issues so save your time and avoid using at all cost.

The phone itself is very good quality with nice night screen. You will not be able to upgrade to the August Android security patch until the Huawei server decided to do so. The US updated are way behind everyone else in the world and Huawei has pretty much forgot about North American market due to ongoing issues with the government. You cannot unlock the bootloader either which pretty much leaves you at the mercy of official updated. So a bad camera and no updates just didn't cut it for me and especially at the price point of $600.

Under the PC desktop mode, the device is quite fast thanks to its 8-core CPU and big memory. The processing speed is comparable to a laptop PC. When edit word documents or heavy processing photos, the device responds quickly. The only tricky part is that most USB/HDMI hubs can not charge the phone while in the desktop mode, I have found that only Cable Matters USB hub supports this. I can now use this as a PC without worrying about the phone battery drainage.[ASIN:B0775KJ4C5 Cable Matters USB C Multiport Adapter]. Additionally, if you are left handed, the device does not provide any way to switch the left and right button on the mouse under the desktop mode, however, I have found ISVO mouse that has a hardware switching mode can accommodate this. Hope Huawei can consider left-handed people in its future release. [ASIN:B077PC62DR IVSO Gaming Mouse]

As photography is my hobby, I truly like this excellent camera phone. It does not have the extra telephoto lens like iPhone X, but it does have a dedicated black and white lens which provides excellent low light shooting results. I shoot in raw mode and can at least recover about half stop details from the image which is very impressive on this mobile device. As a food lover dinning in a dim-lit restaurant, I was able to shoot the food with great details. Firework photos looks fine too. The most impressive feature for the camera is the resolution, the farm house below is at least one mile away, and the camera is able to resolve the details clearly. Shooting into the sun does not cause too much flare and focus correctly. The white balance is accurate in various lighting conditions. That being said, the default JPG image from the camera is over-sharpened IMO. Additionally, when in raw mode, the device still creates a JPG file which is unnecessary and space wasting. Overall, I can now go light and leave my heavy DSL and mirrorless in home while archiving the same photo results.

As to its phone functions, I have tested this side-by-side with my kids LG phone bought this year. I can confirm that this phone transfer the images much faster on the same mobile data network. Also I am now able to make calls at the underground train station which I wasn't able to use my old 4G LTE phone. This device also supports upcoming CAT16/CAT 18 standards.

Overall, this is a great device that allows photographers to shoot great photos, and switch to its desktop mode to conduct the photo editing instantly. I truly love this camera and hope it can last for a few years.",5,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Huawei-Unlocked-Processor-Camera-Resistant/product-reviews/B078T2T2FL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_42?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=42&reviewerType=all_reviews

Things that I love:

1. It came ready with a screen protector already applied. This saved me money and so much hassle!
2. Customizing my phone and app settings is so much easier and intuitive, so the phone feels more like an extension of me rather than a display phone with a few of my stickers on it.
3. Set up was super smooth, quick and simple. Once the new SIM card was in, it was ready to use. Battery was only at 50%, but it charges really fast.
4. A set of headphones (decent sound quality) ending with a male usb c (instead of 3.5mm jack) is included, but they also included an adapter for your favorite 3.5mm headphones. I found that very thoughtful.
5. No bloatware! Even un-carrier phones would have a ton of pre-installed software in addition to the Android stuff, but this one has *very* few additions and they're easy to uninstall or disable.

The only reason I give this 4.5/5 is that there's no option to expand capacity with a micro (or nano) SD card. I know that's a feature available in the mate 20 pro, but I wish this phone had it.

I have been an Android (read Samsung) user for a long time and based on usage of just one week, I can say that this phone easily knocks them out of the park and then some.
It has great battery life (1.5 days in moderate-to-heavy use), 97 rated DxOMark camera, snappy and fast processor, excellent call and network quality (tested on T-Mobile), less bloatware than Samsung or a carrier sold device (thank god in heaven, its unlocked), & an overall beautiful design.
It has it's fair share of shortcomings too for a ""Pro"" model, like no wireless charging, no face unlock, no 3.5mm audio jack, no micro SD slot, no Daydream support (yet). EMUI didn't bother me much, as I got used to it in a few days (just as I got used to Touch wiz on Samsung).

This phone meets most of my requirements and truly is one of the best available Android on sale right now. YMMV.

and i kinda hate it, when you open apps up the screen starts out nice and bright and than it dims to a dull gray drives me crazy.did a google search and people have been complaining about this problem not sure if its software problem or hardware so i know its not me going crazy.  its really a shame because i like the phone but the screen is not making me happy.and i did notice that when you have the brightness turned up all the way it does not dim or you just dont notice it.
huawei are you fixing the problem?and by the way i hate the 18:9 ratio of new phones now.i might send this one back
and try the regular mate 10.and by the way i gave it 2 stars because of the way i see it the screen is a big part of the phone everything else is up to pare

edit:this is a little update to my mate10 pro with the above problems with dimming i had other problems with the phone like
when someone would call and they had a picture for a id it would be so dim and blurry you could not see it.some times the phone rings
sometimes it doesn't  same with the text messages.if you kept the phone on 50 percent brightness it was really dark it just seemed like the phone was getting worse.so i returned it and ended up getting another mate 10 pro so instead of getting the 499.00 mocha i got the blue one that cost 548.00.the new phone is working properly and the screen is working fine i did notice on some apps the screen does dim a little like on chrome but you barely notice it.so in the long run i must of got a faulty unit and i hope the new one holds up.i will leave 2 stars
because i think huawei knows they have a problem  with the phone and hope it can get fixed other people have had this problem.",2,,

First off... this device is BEAUTIFULLY crafted.  Built quality is top notch, no doubt.

Secondly the battery... wow. The battery is excellent, I had to try REALLY hard to drain it.  Will last you a day and a half easy (with modest/average usage) -- I social media'ed on it, surfed the web, emailed, online shopped, YouTube'd, played a game here and there, and the battery held up really really well.

Third, the screen. It's only an FHD+, rather than a QHD (like Samsung/LG/Pixel), but it's a wonderful screen.  I came from a Samsung Galaxy S7 with the QHD screen, and the FHD+ screen on the Mate 10 Pro was just as vibrant. Blacks were pitch black, colors vibrant and viewing angles were all stellar. You won't miss having a QHD screen.  Great OLED.

Fourth, the Kirin 970 and 6GB of RAM performed like a champ.  Opened tons of apps side by side with my Galaxy S7 with a Exynos 8890 and 4GB of RAM, and the Mate 10 Pro opened apps faster and kept more apps in memory than my S7.

Fifth, the Cameras... The cameras on the back were great. Quick to focus, sharp as a tack.  Portrait mode was nice too, although I did find it to incorrectly miss blurring some background or blur some foreground. At a glance the portrait mode photos look beautiful.  But when you zoom in closer to see what's actually going on you see some of the mistakes the bokeh/portrait software make.  The front camera is okay, nothing to write home about. The front camera on my S7 was better and had a wider angle.

Finally, the price was on point, for $499 USD (~$730 CAD after taxes -- that how much I ended up paying in Canadian), you get a great quality handset, awesome specs, and the fact it comes with a screen protector pre-installed AND a clear gel case was a nice touch.

---------------------------
CONs:
---------------------------
1. No headphone jack
2. No wireless charging
3. No location based Smart Unlock!!!! -- This is a stock Android feature... EMUI took this feature out! :(
4. Location Based Smart Unlock via bluetooth is very spotty -- the only Smart Unlock option available.
5. With the fingerprint sensor on the back, there's no double tap to wake which means you have fiddle to find the power button the side (annoying if it's mounted in the car)
6. Notifications on the lock screen work oddly -- can't expand and they disappear once you see them even though you don't action on them.
7. Future software updates are a concern, as it already misses out on the Face Unlock and GPU Turbo while other regions have already got this update or have it scheduled.  The North America version of the Mate 10 Pro, is not even on Huawei's release schedule.

---------------------------
My Deal Breaker:
---------------------------
Given this phone has the finger print sensor on the back, I can't unlock it while it's sitting on the table or mounted in the car, without having to put in my pattern/pin.  Okay... so i tried to get around this by using the Smart Unlock feature -- but their Smart Unlock feature is limited to being paired with a Trusted Bluetooth device... okay, so I tried pairing it with my Smart Watch.  And the Unlock worked... but only sometimes... then I'd have to re-pair the device.  Since I use the phone a lot in my car while it's mounted, there's no convenient way for me to turn it on (no front sensor or double tap to wake) and no reliable way for it to automatically unlock because of the spotty Bluetooth.  In the end... there were a few things I was gonna settle for that weren't ideal, but the BLUETOOTH was the dagger in the heart. Deal breaker! :(

---------------------------
Verdict
---------------------------
Would I recommend this phone? Totally if the cons, particularly to do with the software and the bluetooth, aren't a major concern or deal breakers for you. Mate 20 Pro will be out soon, maybe the Mate 10 Pro will drop even further in price.",3,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Huawei-Unlocked-Processor-Camera-Resistant/product-reviews/B078T2T2FL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_46?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=46&reviewerType=all_reviews

Huawei phones just lost Android support.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2018","Update: It appears that my Mate 10 Pro will not receive anymore updates including monthly security patches since Google has banned them from using Android immediately. I really feel sorry for those that recently spent their hard earned dollars on a new Huawei phone. Watch the prices for their phones plummet!

I am a bit of a smart phone junkie. I have had all of the Note models except the 7 & 9. I also have an S8, S9, Zenfone 5Z and lots of midrange phones.  When I saw the Mate 10 Pro drop to $550 I decided to give it a try and I am so happy I did. The screen is only 1080 and gets bright enough to read in direct sunlight. I have been spoiled by the best screens from Samsung, but this screen is perfectly fine and who really needs WQHD on a 6"" screen anyway. I'll take the drop in res and the extra battery life and while on that topic the battery life on this phone is amazing. Huawei's Kirin processor is fast and sips juice at the same time which is something Samsung had never been able to do. Granted the 4000 mAh battery helps, but the Note 9 with the same size battery will never match this phone in battery life. I have seen over 10 hours of screen on time which is almost double of any other phone I have had and this is with 4 email accounts and 3 different security camera systems running in the background. It's the only phone I have ever had that didn't need to be charged at some point during the day and I have yet to read about any other phone that has better battery life. It charges very quickly and will go from 0 to 60% in 30 minutes.

Build quality is easily as good as the best from Samsung & Apple and it is a very comfortable phone to hold for extended periods. With 128 gigs of storage there is no need for an SD card ""at least for me"" and 6 gigs of RAM makes it fly and run smoothly. In daily use it is as fast as my S9 and it is more fluid. I don't use wired headphones so the lack of a 3.5mm jack is a moot point.
The stereo speakers are very good and get loud enough for most any situation. I didn't think I would use the infrared port, but I ended up programming my TV and my girlfriends TV to it and use my phone for the remote anytime I watch TV.

The cameras are very good even in low light, but they are not quite as good as my S9 & Note 8. If those two are 10's the M10P cameras get an 8.

Cell reception seems to be a little better than my Samsungs, picking up signals in fringe areas where my other phones did not.

Lastly, the finger print sensor is as good as they get and it makes all of the others feel inferior.

This phone is a steal at its current price and my all time favorite.",5,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Huawei-Unlocked-Processor-Camera-Resistant/product-reviews/B078T2T2FL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_42?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=42&reviewerType=all_reviews

My holy grail: a really good phone, combined with a really good camera, with a large-ish screen that fits my large-ish hands.

I have both the Mate 10 Pro and the Mate 9 in hand right now, with the intent to keep the one that I prefer. I am likely going to be keeping the Mate 10 Pro.

Where It's Better than Mate 9

- Viewing angles on screen
- Light evenness on screen
- Performance (slightly)
- Maximum camera aperture (f/1.6 vs. f/2.2—the primary reason I'm upgrading)
- Built-in memory capacity (128GB vs 64GB)

Where Mate 9 is Better (IMO)

- Screen size (both are 6"" diagonal, but the 9 is 16:9 HD, while the Mate 10 is 18:9 and has less area)
- Dual SIM capable and SD capable (Mate 10 Pro is one SIM, no SD)
- Build quality (not a fan of all-glass)
- Speakers (Mate 9 has more of them and they sound better)
- Screen color (richer than Mate 10 Pro, which is odd, because 9 is IPS while Mate 10 Pro is AMOLED)

At the end of the day, both the Mate 10 Pro and the Mate 9 are VERY good to excellent Android phones, easily a match for any manufacturer's flagships right now. Blindingly fast and smooth, great screens, industry-leading battery life and battery optimization, industry-leading fingerprint scanner, great compatibility, just a joy to use all around.

The Camera Question

If you're like me, however, the main reason you were drawn to these phones is for the camera. On this front, neither is as good as the Panasonic DMC-CM1 (nothing else on the market is, either). I still miss it daily, but the phone half of that phone was getting to be too old to be usable as a phone.

The Mate 9 at max f/2.2 aperture is pretty good, but noise reduction artifacts become an issue indoors and in dimmer light. Enough of an issue to bug me and cause me to invest in the Mate 10 Pro as an experiment for comparison. Also, the tiny sensor and f/2.2 aperture just meant absolutely no DOF control whatsoever. Yes, there is software simulation of shallow DOF, but it only really works for portraits—when there is something in the foreground and something in the background.

If you want to see this software simulation fall down quickly, just get something long (a bridge, railroad tracks, a subject lying down) and photograph them using software DOF mode. The part nearest the lens will be in focus. The part farthest away from the lens will be blurred. And in the middle, rather than a gradual transition (as you would get from a real wide aperture lens on a large sensor), you see a sudden transition from sharp to blurry where the software decided the transition from ""foreground"" to ""background"" happens.

In short, it's not real DOF control and in most non-portrait shooting situations, it just can't be made to look like real DOF control.

That said, I do very much like the rest of the image quality coming out of the Mate 9/10 series, particularly in RAW mode. So the goal became to get the largest aperture possible for this tiny sensor. That is f/1.6 on the Mate 10 Pro.

Is it worth the upgrade? For me it is.

What would my ideal be? Probably the Mate 10 Pro camera in the Mate 9 body.

Or even better, the same camera module but with an f/1.0 lens (I don't mind if it protrudes a bit like some other phones) in the Mate 9 body.

But you go with what's available—and that's the Mate 10 Pro, for now. Five stars because in comparison to all the other phones on the market, it's amongst the top 2-3, if not the very top.",5,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Huawei-Unlocked-Processor-Camera-Resistant/product-reviews/B078T2T2FL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews

(and beautiful design)","Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2018","Where do I begin with how well rounded and as close to perfect you can get that this phone is?  Everyone has their preferences – some people want a great camera, some a big easy to read screen, and others it may be long battery life.  For me, I love to travel and the two most important features were battery life and the camera.  With a 4,000 mAh battery and an in-house manufactured Kirin 970 processor, the battery life is insane.  Of course, it’s a lot like cars and fuel mileage; how you drive them and how you use them affects results.  For me, heavy WhatsApp, medium camera and video use, and YouTube.  I always get a full day of use with around 35% left over, and I consider myself a heavy user.  Don’t just take it from me though, read reviews on the Mate 10 Pro and you’ll constantly see it’s battery is among its highest-rated attributes.  The reason I mentioned the processor is that by utilizing their in-house System-on-a-chip (SOC), Huawei can better program the phone and processor to best use available resources and achieve amazing battery life.
Second, the camera.  Wow!  Again, check out how Huawei scored with their phones over at DxoMark, a prestigious camera ranking firm.  They are not only #1 on the list but also have several phones in the top 10.  I can’t always have my DSLR with me, so, I needed a phone which can achieve the best results from mobile photography I can find.  And, if you’re into photography, you’ll know the Leica name.  The dynamic range is superb, there are not any blown out highlights or over-sharpening, and details are clear.  The camera app is stable with no crashes and shoots pictures at a very fast speed.
I’ve been using the phone case that came in the box and I don’t feel the need for an aftermarket.  It’s clear, so it doesn’t hide how gorgeous the phone is, and isn’t slippery either.  Another huge benefit is the integrated EMUI desktop mode.  You only need to purchase an HDMI to type-c adapter (around $15), and you get a great desktop experience.  Most all apps run full screen, and I hook up a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse and run Word to do my schoolwork.  I’ve even played some games (with a Bluetooth controller), and it’s an awesome mobile gaming rig when you’re at a hotel!
There are a couple of cons about the phone which are not extremely negative, but suggestions for Huawei.  First, I work in an environment that is fairly loud most of the time.  I can’t seem to find a ringtone that is loud enough for me always to hear it.  I’m not sure if it a speaker issue, or that I’m going deaf.  On that note, the vibration of the phone isn’t that strong.  It’s definitely adequate, and I understand you don’t want something to vibrate so much that parts fly off, but, the unit could use some improvement in that area.  The phone is “water-resistant” rated, so I understand why the concept of no expandable memory is there, but, there is a SIM tray so it shows it could be done.  Also, I understand the idea behind the “cloud” so physical memory isn’t that important.  However, when you’re away from signal on a hiking trip and recording gobs of 4k video, physical memory becomes important until you can upload it.  128GB is a great amount, but either offer 256GB and 512GB variants, or allow for expandable memory in the future.
Speaking of the future, this saddens me.  Huawei makes a stunning and gorgeous phone with amazing performance and features, and because of “concerns” by the United States government, they have lobbied U.S. cell phone companies to not sell their products.  To me, without proof, this is unfounded.  Heck, the NSA probably spies on me more than a foreign country does.  I fell in love with Huawei devices after I started using them with the Mate 9.  However, I had to get an international version of the Mate 9 at the time and even though it worked in the U.S., it did not have all the LTE bands.  I noticed when using the Mate 9, my signal would not always be the greatest and speeds were acceptable.  Upon buying the Mate 10 Pro (which Huawei included U.S. bands for the market), I get all the bands, great reception, and ridicules LTE speeds.  Huawei recently released a phone called the P20 Pro with a 40 MP sensor and three camera system.  Co-engineered with Leica, it achieves stunning results and is not a marketing gimmick.  I would do anything to have this device here in the U.S!  Yes, I can buy the “international version”; however, it does not function as well as the phones tuned specifically for U.S. markets.  Now, all I can do is a dream and hope Huawei will continue to try and break into the U.S. market with their exceptional products.
In closing, if you want a gorgeous phone that runs buttery smooth with no hiccups, takes breathtaking photos, has insane battery life, and is a great price – please please please consider buying this phone!  I can not say how satisfied and happy I am I made this purchase!  I just hope to have a U.S. version of the P20 Pro one day.",5,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Huawei-Unlocked-Processor-Camera-Resistant/product-reviews/B078T2T2FL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_42?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=42&reviewerType=all_reviews

This is a very beautiful paperweight.  It excels at everything EXCEPT actually being a phone. I'll provide a quick summary for people who just want the overview then go into detail below. As an FYI - I replaced the first phone after three weeks.  Called in to return the second after 4 days.

PROS
Speedy.  Responsive. Beautiful.

CONS
Can't maintain a Bluetooth connection. Can't maintain a call over Wi-Fi.  Can't maintain a call over cellular.  Can't receive calls.  Transferring apps and data to the phone does not work well.  Only partially transferred  data, then stopped working. Piss poor customer support. Does not come with visual voicemail installed.

Here's the message I sent to HUAWEI about the details.  These messages were after the calls.
DETAILS
Phone #1 - 1) the phone clone app does not connect.  Getting a connection so I can copy the contents of my other phone over where painful and took forever.  Does not work as advertised. 2) Dropped Bluetooth connections and would during calls, people would complain of not being able to hear me. Even though I could hear them. Then they'd hang up. Because they couldn't hear me. 3) would lose internet connection.  Customer support would only tell me to factory reset or send phone in to be serviced.  So I would either lose my data. Or have people not be able to contact me for a week.  I returned this phone to Amazon and got a new on on Friday (March 16th).

Phone #2 - 1) loses internet connection.  Even though it says it's connected to the internet it loses internet connection.  2) after several minutes on the phone, people were complaining of not being able to hear me and then they would disconnect the phone because they thought the phone call had ended..  After unsuccessful attempts to receive help from Huawei support, I was able to determine that calls made over Wi-Fi would be the ones where people complained of not being able to hear me.  All of my other phones are able to do this without an issue, but the Huawei phone is unable to handle this.  3). Now this is the BIG ONE.  All of a sudden, this phone stopped receiving phone calls.  I had very important calls coming in and this phone wouldn't even register that a phone call has been made to me. I can call out just fine (as long as I talk fast enough to get my message out before the phone decides to mute me).  But this phone refuses to accept calls now.

FYI
For both phones, Huawei suggested I reset the phone.  Even the one that was fresh out of the box. Only 4 days old.  They didn't offer much beyond that.

Do not get this phone if you're not already an expert at setup or are new to Android.

The Mate 10 series will be the first to receive the GPU Turbo update at the end of June 2018. Huawei’s GPU Turbo increases the processing power of the GPU by up to 60% while reducing power consumption by 30%. The new feature was announced last week.

And that is not all folks; Huawei also announced some new features coming to the Mate 10 series. First, the Mate 10's will support cloud computing starting June 26. It will then receive the EMUI 8.1 update in mid-July which will bring 960fps slow-motion recording. Exciting indeed!

I, unfortunately, did not order mine which arrives today from Amazon because they were out of the Midnight Blue, but I will be posting my review once I have received the device and have had time to break it in.

Update: 6/15/2018 - I received my Mate 10 Pro yesterday and absolutely fell in love with it, but it does have a major issue (reported below.) Firstly, the phone is beautiful, fast, and no Bluetooth issues like I had with my Huawei Honor 8, especially connecting to my car's Bluetooth (Nougat lacked many Bluetooth codecs.) I have only taken a few photos but was completely blown away. What I noticed most was the sound quality is MUCH better and the included headphones which look like the iPhone version, are better than Apple's. I was surprised. Battery life ....the best. The screen is bright and beautiful and the phone is large but doesn't feel large. It is just something you have to experience. It also looked thick in the youtube videos and add photos, but this is a very thin phone, feels great in the hand. Everything perfect, except for one glaring software issue....

MAJOR ISSUE: BACKGROUND RUNNING APPS ARE KILLED. I would advise not buying this phone if you need any background apps to run in the background. There is a long post about this glaring Huawei issue on XDA, many reporting it to Huawei's customer service who blame outside apps and refuse to address the issue. This is not true. It is an EMUI issue (see the XDA forum for details,) and it also happens on the Huawei Mate 9 and P20 with Oreo. There are settings in the ""Battery"" options that should allow you to keep certain apps running in the background, but they don't work. This also affects certain apps and widgets that need to refresh in the background. Most of Google's apps refresh and work, but many outside apps don't.  Until Huawei steps up and recognizes they have a major issue, I can't recommend this phone fully at this time.

Update: 07/14/2018
I wanted to add a few comments since I have had the phone for some time. I noticed a user replied that I should keep opening my app for at least a couple of weeks as a fix. I tried this, actually over two weeks, and it still kills my app in the background.

A new issue I thought I would list is phone updates. I would really think strongly against buying any Huawei phone if updates, even small security releases from Google each month, are a concern. In the North American phones, Huawei refuses to update their phones. Mind you, the Mate 10 was their ""flagship phone."" There is a new report out of the NOYPIGEEKS dot com entitled, ""Huawei and Honor GPU Turbo software update schedule revealed."" Google it. You will notice they list the release schedule for this big update...and the US is not listed in the roll-out. I thought when purchasing this phone we Huawei said we were suppose to get regular security updates and at least 1 major OS update. I am assuming Huawei is ignoring the security updates and is going to wait and update the US phones whenever Android P is released. That is unacceptable. I will never buy another Huawei phone again.

Update 8/10/2018: So, Huawei finally released a US update, but don't get too excited. It has been revealed in the news that the US will not be getting the Turbo update everyone wants. There is also no facial recognition in this update either. The update included Google security fixes and a camera update .....but the update breaks the camera's Night mode and some users report that can't take pictures at all. Way to go Huawei. They say on their chat that a fix is coming, but it is been about a month now and nothing. So, for those of you that see an update ending in .119, don't install it.",1,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Huawei-Unlocked-Processor-Camera-Resistant/product-reviews/B078T2T2FL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_56?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=56&reviewerType=all_reviews

Pray that you dont hit a warranty issue.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 23, 2018","I own a Huawei device and am currently having the bad luck to go through warranty issues with Huawei customer service. The device is getting heated, random reboots, the microphone has issues, the charger stopped working and the battery life reduced around just 5 hrs on a full charge. I was made to send my device twice and every time, I reach the customer service, they make me go through all the details starting from imei to asking for device images(This is even after providing my ticket number - and every time I call they give a new ticket number and they loose information between all these tickets. so they ask you to provide all the ticket numbers since you started this warranty claim.  They just want to make sure you stop calling them). Even after multiple escalations and follow up they ended up sending the device back without fixing the any of the issues raised. And the worst part is they made a lot of scratches to the device while opening it and are refusing fix it. Now after multiple follow they have blamed it on me staring the scratches existed even when I had sent the device to them for the first time.

At this point, though my device is in warranty I am unable to do anything about all these issues.  Have filed an FTC complaint and hoping something will turn around.

If you end up buying any kind of Huawei device, just pray that you should not end up with a warranty issue which will lead you to deal with their customer service.  Or better stay away from this getting yourself into this kind of scenario if you know what I mean.",1,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Huawei-Unlocked-Processor-Camera-Resistant/product-reviews/B078T2T2FL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_40?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=40&reviewerType=all_reviews

The phone frequently tells me I have no signal (in the middle of Boston) and struggles to load pages on the subway or around town even when the signal bars show as full. Instagram has crashed several times, a text I sent to a group went to one individual only (she showed me on her phone that it only went to her even though my phone made it look like it went to the group) and all my text messages with my boyfriend, which had been imported from the Nexus 6P, were just gone one day.
I also don't love all the Huawei apps that are installed as alternatives to Google apps, and had to figure out how to disable them all to avoid getting two sets out notifications all the time. The headphones are like airplane ones, hard plastic that won't stay put in your ears, and which are super uncomfortable. They were 'free' with the phone though, so I'm not complaining about that too much. The free case and headphone jack converter were nice.
The camera is good and I do value the fact that the phone is water resistant and has eye comfort mode.

It also comes with a soft protector case, which is one less decision to make, which is really a pleasant experience.

The hardware is fast, I play PUBG on it and the load time is fast and game play is smooth on high settings.

-It charges super quick with the included charger.
-No headphone jack but there is a included adapter and a pair of headphones.
-Accessories aren't as abundant as they would be for a Galaxy phone or iPhone.
- the camera is pretty good. Most shots look great!
- Huawei's skin is mostly good.
- no microSD slot but you're getting 128gb internal storage out of the box.

It's an even better deal now that it's down to $550 (purchased when it was $650). I have been using it daily for a few months now- it is replacing my Huawei Nexus 6P.

Setup: It was almost a seamless setup for me...Almost.  I ran into issues in regards to the Huawei data transfer app. It would not connect at all, so I went with another app and it went smooth as butter

Performance and battery life:  I have not noticed any issues with performance. I do not play games much using this phone, but I use google, youtube, messaging, and media apps a lot. Apps are snappy upon loading, fingerprint is immediate upon touch(almost too sensitive if that's possible). No strange bugs yet or crashes/freezes. Charging is insanely fast...faster than you'll ever really need especially if you leave it overnight - it'll finish probably within an hour.

More recently I've decided to try out Apple Music which surprisingly does not drain the battery life on this.  I can get through two days easily with no charging.  I have seen many days where I have music playing almost the whole day, watching videos occasionally and finding myself with enough battery life for the next day.

Quirks:
-The knuckle screenshot is a bit useless to me. Half the time it works, half the time it doesn't.  One time - the knuckle screenshot activated upon using my regular fingertips.  I was just scrolling! Will disable if possible
-You cannot disable certain Huawei Apps...This is absolutely annoying. If you root the phone, you may be able to mess around, but I plan on keeping  this stock. The issue that I came across was when I used Apple Music over bluetooth.  Upon enabling and connecting bluetooth, Huawei's Music App started playing instead of Apple Music. I cannot disable Huawei's Music App or make Apple Music the default App.",5,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Huawei-Unlocked-Processor-Camera-Resistant/product-reviews/B078T2T2FL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews

Also, I grew a little tired of the ugly layout of EMUI so I am using Nova Launcher and everything has a perfect layout now! This phone is cheaper than when I bought it, so don't hesitate to get this device. Mine is still super fast! Also, check out some attached camera samples and the Nova Launcher layout.

This phone is great! I bought it on sale as a second phone while I ship my Samsung Galaxy S8+ off to be fixed. I initially wanted something cheap and basic, but I was continually drawn to this. I'm so glad I didn't settle for a $100 Nokia or Motorola. This phone has a screen just a notch below my Samsung, better speakers, a better in hand feel and some other spec improvements! As a phone on sale for $550, I don't think there is a better option out there. It makes me have buyer's remorse for getting locked into a contract with a $850 Samsung that I'm not in love with anymore.

Coming from a Pixel 2XL on AT&T I took out my sim and put it in the Mate 10 Pro and I find I have VoLTE (like a certified AT&T phone) with excellent signal and voice quality better than any AT&T certified phone I have. The phone has excellent battery life (way better than my Pixel or my Note 8) and is as fast as either of the top flagships. The weight is excellent and it has good feel in the hand, and the vibration motor is also really good for haptic feedback. Display is a really good OLED panel that looks very Samsung tuned (which means viewing angles and color saturation is near perfect). Sound is also real loud and speakers are stereo so it's fun to use. Finally the camera is the best in the Android business with lots of features and excellent color and exposure. Comparatively to the Pixel 2 XL I see some shots on my Mate 10 Pro are better, especially low light, and the selfies are good when you turn off beauty mode. It's has a great portrait mode as well. I would recommend this phone to any iPhone or Android user and could promise a good experience once you tweak it the way you like it.

A little background, I was skeptical about getting this phone not because of the huawei brand, but because of the screen size and lack of desire to change from what I 've been used to. Keep in mind, I had been using a Huawei mate 7 for the past three years with no problems except the once in a while lagging (which you should expect the older a phone gets). What eventually pushed me to 'need' another phone is that the camera on my huawei mate 7 finally gave up. It wouldn't save pictures, I couldn't view images/videos, it was at this point I was forced to buy a new phone. The next closest similar phone to the mate 7 was the mate 9 which unfortunately does not have the EMUI/Android 8 specs of the mate 10 pro. I am sooo used to the mate 7's build, that changing to and accepting the mate 10's build will take a little while to grow on me. So far, in the last 24 hrs, the mate 10 pro has been holding up pretty good as expected. If you are indecisive, watch a lot of youtube videos of the phones you're interested in, and this will help you decide. The only thing I don't like so far is the phone's ability to fall asleep while its still in use, have to figure out how to change that, its probably a power saving thing. Finally, the huawei brand has never disappointed me. My last mate 7 lasted me for a good 3 YEARS, a rarity today in modern phone tech world. And last but not least, my main reason for pursuing huawei in the first place, was because I wanted something different from the usual samsung, iphone, htc, motorola phones that you see everyone with. I just wanted sthing different, and huawei delivers that difference at a great price. Secretly, I was overjoyed they didn't break into the US market like they wanted to bcos then I would have had to look for something else like the one plus phones or google's pixel, which huawei still beats anytime anyday in my opinion. Yay huawei......9 times out of 10, I know i'm the only huawei user in the room and that is enough.

8 month Update...
So I have had the phone for about 8 months now and here's what I have noticed so far...
The phone's superior battery life is beginning to wane. It started right around the 7 month mark. It does not charge and last all day like it used to.
Secondly, the phone goes to sleep mode in mid-use. You can be scrolling through the phone, temporarily get distracted and boom the phone goes off in mid-use...
The phone going off in use doesn't bother me as much as the battery life waning. With the battery life beginning to show signs of going downhill, I'm beginning to think it might be time to start thinking of a new phone soon and its not even a year yet...i miss my mate 7...lasted 3 years and I'm still craving for its awesomeness...oh well..technology and life moves on it would seem...",3,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/Huawei-Unlocked-Processor-Camera-Resistant/product-reviews/B078T2T2FL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_37?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=37&reviewerType=all_reviews

I am coming from a Galaxy S7 and this is a definite step up.

I had read that the Bluetooth on these can have some connectivity issues, but I have seen zero evidence of this. My Bluetooth automatically connects to saved devices such as my car stereo. The songs and artists display as they should.

The battery life is unbelievable. The battery is gigantic, and the 5amp Supercharging is insane. I think in addition to having a gigantic battery that the phone itself has some smart battery utilization. This may be from the AI chip divvying out the energy. I work in a place where there is spotty service and my old Galaxy would need to be charged halfway through the day searching for signal. Now I go home with 65% battery life remaining which is insane to me.

The thing is stupid fast with 6 gigs of RAM. Almost nothing else on the market has this much virtual memory. Awesome speed for sure.

Android 8.0 lacks a few features that I like, but it's customizable so it isn't a huge issue. The native text app, I think Google messaging, no longer supports silencing notifications for conversations. If you have that pesky group message that blows up your phone will will go off non-stop. This means you have to download a third party messaging app in order to silence particular conversations. Textra has worked seamlessly for me.

One bummer is that (on the AT&T network) VoLTE is not supported. For me this means no WI-FI calls or texts. SMS is only supported when you have service. With AT&T branded devices you can send texts and make calls over Wi-Fi, but that feature is not supported on this unlocked phone.

All in all its great. Best phone I have every had and it works with zero headache. Gorgepus display, crazy fast, awesome battery life.

Calls and audio work great.  I disabled some of the Huwai features, interface is clean and easy to use.  All of the apps are available in Play store and work great.

While I can not compare to the latest generation i-phone, I am really impressed with the camera.  The zoom is an engineering marvel and night mode is stunning.

On a down note, It does use proprietary memory cards but, the good news is that those are available.  I did order and install one, all good although more expensive than a standard memory card.

Only about a week into it but so far it is excellent.  Will update if anything changes,",5,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/HUAWEI-Factory-Unlocked-International-Version/product-reviews/B07Q2WPMNB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews

The most impressive thing about this phone in my opinion is not the camara. Don't get me wrong, the camera is as good as everybody else said. However, I don't think the image quality here can replace what I get from my DSLR or my mirror less. It's just above average when compare to other phones in the market and having full set of lenses that fits in my pocket is quite a new experience.
Now, back to what I love the most about P30 Pro, it's the battery. When I opened the box for the first time, the phone had 33% of battery. I received the phone at work around 10:30am and didn't have a chance to recharge it. I ran around all day that day and used the phone like usual, making calls, texts, emails, read documents, web search, GPS, etc. Only didn't have a chance to watch video or listen to music. By 9:30pm, 11 hours later, the battery went down to 1% and I just barely made it home. So, 33% for 11 hours with normal usage is pretty good for me considering my old phone can never last more than 4 hours in the same circumstance.
After the first day, I always start the day with 95-100% battery. My days normally start at 8:30am to 10:00pm. I've always come home with 40% left after 13.5 hours. This is definitely new to me. No more powerbank, no more looking around for an outlet to charge my phone, no more fighting over the charger with my wife and kids when we're outside, no more rushing to my bedroom to charge my dying phone when I get home, etc. I can use my P30 Pro as much as I like when I'm outside without worrying about putting the phone in battery saving mode. When I came home, now I can relax, sit in the living room a bit, spend time in the kitchen a bit. Unlike before that I have to run to my bedroom to charge my phone right away because it's about to die in 5 minutes. What a difference sensation.
Just an FYI, my old phone was a 2 years old Samsung with 3600mAh battery. My wife's is a year old iPhone that battery always run out at the end of the day. P30 Pro last all the way through the night.
The second best thing about this phone is the charger. I used Samsung all these years and very familiar with their fast charge. However, I've never seen anything like Huawei's Super charge. It's just crazy fast.
A lot of times at night, I went to bed and forgot to charge my phone. Woke up at 5:00am to realize it and start charging the phone. Usually, the phone has about 35% left. After taking shower and getting dress which took me about 20 minutes, once I'm done the phone will be charged up to 90% already. If I waited 15 minutes more, it'll go up to 100%.
Couple days ago, I spent a lot of time waiting for people so I watch a lot of videos to kill time. I used up the battery more than usual but still had 26% left by the time I got home. So, watch and stream video consumed more power but wouldn't completely drain out the battery of P30 Pro.

Enough with the battery, as I mentioned before, the camera is good for as long as you don't expect the full frame or APS-C quality. For smartphone, However, this is absolutely the best for still photos.
Video, unfortunately, is another matter. Although P30 Pro can shoot 4k but it's only limit at 30fps. If you're looking for a better video capability, Samsung S10+ is a better choice because it can shoot 4k60. The P30 Pro, on the other hand, is limit even at 1080p because it's only does 60fps while S10+ can go upto 1080p240. Big difference.

The screen is only full HD, not quad like S10+ but it's still AMOLED and looks good with every tasks. I have no complain about the quality of the screen. In fact, I already dropped this phone once in my garage, face down. There's no crack or scratch and still works perfectly fine so I know it's durable.

The Emui, I don't know why people complain so much about Huawei interface. Some people said it's look too much like iPhone with all the apps present on screen. Well, there's a drawer too if you choose to use it and make it feels more like Samsung. To me, there are some features I like that easier than Samsung and there are some features that's harder as well. No matter which phone you choose, it'll never be 100% perfect so why complain?

I will conclude my review here that this P30 Pro is one of the best in the market right now, especially the battery and charger. I might have something else to add but that'd be in the future.

Add comment 1: I was so busy lately and only have a chance to walk around a bit last night. So, I'd like to add some photos I took with P30 Pro. The first 3 photos just to show  the difference between each lenses from wide angle to 10x zoom (actually, it's more like 16mm, 27mm and 270mm prime).",4,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/HUAWEI-Factory-Unlocked-International-Version/product-reviews/B07Q2WPMNB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews

I have since seen the Note 10+ and the features are comparable but the P30 Pro is more professional (the Pro settings are more like a 35mm than the Note 10+) and the zoom is a marvel.  The Pixl 4+ may be better yet but it's not out. The iPhone 11's are nowhere near the P30 Pro in their specs.  Look at the MP ratings.

I included three pictures.  The butterfly (a Mourning Cloak) was taken hand held at 1X on a windy day. It shows the detail the camera can get under difficult conditions.  The boats show the detail it can pick out in a standard landscape. The waterlilies were shot with the telephoto from about 30 yards.  All these were handheld and a tripod would have allowed the AI to beef up the detail.  None have been modified or edited.  I have only had this phone about 3 weeks and I'm still learning how to use it.  I have a picture of a heron that was about 100 yards away handheld.  The camera's AI tries to improve detail by having you hold the camera steady but without a tripod it produced shadowing.

Other features need work by the owner.  Google software takes the place of Huawei's systems in most cases.  This is not always smooth for me as I am not an expert on the area.  After three weeks I've adjusted to most of the software differences.

The current price at Amazon for a Huawei P30 Pro is about 60% of the best new iPhones and much less than Samsung's.  Worried about the ""spy thing""?  The President of MicroSoft, its chief legal officer, recently asked the administration to stop the nonsense and allow Huawei to fully enter the US market.  Whom to believe -- an industry bigwig or twelve-lies-a-day-Donnie?  Politics aside, the Huawei P30 Pro packs a great camera into an excellent phone.

My hobby is photography, and I thought the iPhone Xs camera was amazing, but the P30 blows that camera out of the water in so many ways. The 10x digital zoom is unbelievable sharp, and the 5x optical zoom is unparalleled. The phone has a beautiful feel in the hand, even with a case. I think part of that is the narrow width/longer length. Even though the screen specs are nowhere near those of the Galaxy10, I find it crisp and bright. EMUI might be antiquated, but I find it perfectly functional. Although it is expensive, even the basic version is 8GB RAM and 128GB memory is a huge leap from my Xs, for less money. My only complaint so far is the facial recognition - it barely works. Sometimes, even in perfect light and no hat or sunglasses, it doesn't work. But I sure like having a unique camera. Here in the US, the carrier monopoly offers such a limited selection, resulting in most people having the same phones, which at the higher end are iPone/Galaxy/Pixel.",5,,

As a phone though, it is a limited yet vanilla experience.
Chipset wise you will be hard pressed to find a faster Android on the market. It is blazingly fast and seems to retain it's speed overtime. Also to mention is the battery life which is somewhere between amazing and epic. The fast charging will put enough juice in the device in 30 mins to keep it powered for a day or so.  This can be a bit troublesome though as it's fast speed and fantastic battery life are a result of aggressive task killing and limiting background processes. This frequently causes issues for some apps that are working in the background or even streaming audio. This can be remedied with exceptions but still worth mentioning.
2 sim cards can be used nativly and it is hands down the best software I have ever used for managing two sims. No other Chinese phones have come close to that level of plug and play with hot swapping sims.

The most exciting part though and exclusively what I paid for is the sensor and photo AI. The zoom is simply incredible. You will not believe it at first.  It zooms optically for a very low noise zoom, pushing the limit triggers the AI which does a fantastic job of stabilization at up to 50X.  It is even able to capture color and exposure accurately at range. The night mode is also incredibly powerful but demands a tripod or very steady hand. Essentially a long exposure but with the miracle of the sensor that somehow fills in the details at a level your eye can not even see.",4,Next page?,https://www.amazon.com/HUAWEI-Factory-Unlocked-International-Version/product-reviews/B07Q2WPMNB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews

It charges so quickly it is difficult to believe. That is it's absolutely best feature. Advanced android OS is the other - the ability to do things like back up to a NAS i have on my home network automatically, etc. Works extremely well as a phone - much louder and clearer than other phones I have used.

There's no competition. If price is not a factor get this phone. That said. it is pricey (on par with Pixel3) but it blows the pixel 3 out of the water. More powerful specs, better camera and overall much more premium feeling when you hold it in your hand. Some people consider EMUI a down side but honestly not me. I quite enjoy the gesture based navigation and I haven't had any real problems so far.

To be noted this particular product listing did NOT come with a free clear plastic case like you might see in various unboxing videos. The super charger that comes with it is EU plug (it came with a super cheap adapter to convert to US but it's cheap and not a very stable connection so i recommend getting a better adapter.)

I recommend registering for a huawei ID ahead of time on a computer because I ran into issues doing it on the device. If you are getting this to use on Google Fi make sure you order a free sim card from google prior to getting the phone. Despite being advertised as ""Sim-Free"" this is not the same as Google Fi ""Sim-free setup"". all it means in this case is they don't include a sim because it's unlocked for all carriers, you still need to put a sim in sim slot 1 for service it's not eSim capable",5,,
